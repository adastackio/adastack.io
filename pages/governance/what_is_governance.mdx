# What is Cardano Governance?

Cardano has a system of democratic governance in which ADA holders can propose or vote on proposals. These proposals invoke an action on Cardano such as changing fees. This system puts decision-making in the hands of the users so that it aligns well to their needs over time.

Governance also gives the Cardano community control over the Cardano treasury. Voters and decide how to allocate the budget. The treasury is consistently growing because it receives a small portion of every transaction fee.

Governance is a key element in the long-term strategy of Cardano because it means that the blockchain can be self-sustaining and and sets a path for continued innovation and community participation.

Governance is [in the process of being implemented](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/) and should be fully available soon.
