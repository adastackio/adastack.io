# Blockchain Explorers

Blockchain Explorers allow you to explore transactions, blocks, epochs, staking, metadata, tokens, pools, and more.

- [Cexplorer](https://cexplorer.io/) is a top Cardano explorer. The app has a simple interface for looking at the blockchain's history. Support Cexplorer's development by staking to [POOLS](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool1cduc7ut6grhqyavrmm3gzcdf4qfdsjk7vdwcxy9c0r5fyaxh2sqhttps://) or making a [donation](https://cexplorer.io/donate).

- [CardanoScan](https://cardanoscan.io/) is a powerful, fully-featured Cardano explorer built by the team that created [Flac Finance](https://twitter.com/FlacFinance) and [Typhon Wallet](https://twitter.com/TyphonWallet). Support ongoing development by delegating to [CSN1](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool10hex9l4wjgqarvhr94xgyh9frv5lhtajhrj4dah0kl65jtws30khttps://) and [CSN2](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool1mfgqn8n658vjdcvg3xgtr3qyet64fht0dzsukqeznxw36z8g2k6https://).

- [AdaStat](https://adastat.net/) is another great Cardano explorer. The site also has a rich dashboard when viewing [stake pool stats](https://adastat.net/pools). They also display the results of [on-chain votes](https://adastat.net/polls). You can support AdaStat's development by staking to [STAT](https://adastat.net/pools/77b0a93c26ac65be36e9a9f220f9a43cbc57d705fc5d8f1de5fdeea1).

- [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/) is an IOHK supported project. It is a straightforward app to search epochs, blocks, addresses, and transactions. It is also [open source](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-explorer-app).

- [Eutxo.org](https://eutxo.org/) is a unique blockchain visualizer tool. You can search for specific blocks in history to see a visual representation of everything that happened within that block. Support the project by making a [donation](https://eutxo.org/contact).

- [AdaPools](https://adapools.org/) is another tool from the creators of Cexplorer. It seems like a lightweight version of Cexplorer but still includes the important things you'd expect from a blockchain explorer.

- [Raw Cardano](https://rawcardano.app/) is a useful explorer tool for developers because it returns raw json results. This means that programmers can use the results in their programs. Support the creators at [QXT](https://twitter.com/quixotepool) and [PIADA](https://twitter.com/Piada_stakePool).

- [Blockchair](https://blockchair.com/cardano) is a "universal blockchain explorer and search engine" that works automatically with many blockchains including Cardano.

- [3xpl](https://3xpl.com/cardano) is another multi-blockchain explorer that supports Cardano. It works well but lacks some features of a fully Cardano-oriented solution.
