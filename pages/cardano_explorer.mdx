Cardano Blockchain Explorers allow you to explore transactions, blocks, epochs, staking, metadata, tokens, pools, and more.

[Cexplorer](https://cexplorer.io/) is a top blockchain explorer in Cardano. The app has a really simple and intuitive UI. Created by Cardano OG [Cardanians](https://twitter.com/Cardanians_io) and others. You can support Cexplorer's development by staking to [POOLS](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool1cduc7ut6grhqyavrmm3gzcdf4qfdsjk7vdwcxy9c0r5fyaxh2sqhttps://) or making a [donation](https://cexplorer.io/donate).

[CardanoScan](https://cardanoscan.io/) is a powerful and fully featured Cardano explorer. The app is built by the team that created [Flac Finance](https://twitter.com/FlacFinance) and [Typhon Wallet](https://twitter.com/TyphonWallet). [Some of its features](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/8/f8-developer-ecosystem/cardanoscanio-upgrade) have been funded by Project Catalyst. Support its ongoing development by delegating to [CSN1](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool10hex9l4wjgqarvhr94xgyh9frv5lhtajhrj4dah0kl65jtws30khttps://) and [CSN2](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool1mfgqn8n658vjdcvg3xgtr3qyet64fht0dzsukqeznxw36z8g2k6https://).

[AdaStat](https://adastat.net/) is another great alternative for exploring the Cardano blockchain. The site is optimized for assessing [stake pools](https://adastat.net/pools) because it provides a dashboard summarizing their overall stats. They also do tracking of [on-chain votes](https://adastat.net/polls). You can support AdaStat's development by staking to [STAT](https://adastat.net/pools/77b0a93c26ac65be36e9a9f220f9a43cbc57d705fc5d8f1de5fdeea1).

The [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/) is an IOHK supported project. It is a straightforward way to search through epochs, blocks, addresses, and transactions. It is [open source](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-explorer-app), though it looks like it doesn't get updated very often.

[Eutxo.org](https://eutxo.org/) is a unique blockchain visualizer tool. You can search for specific blocks in history to see a cool visual representation of its transactions.

[AdaPools](https://adapools.org/) is another tool from the creators of Cexplorer. It is like a lightweight version of Cexplorer but still includes the main features you'd expect from a blockchain explorer.

[Raw Cardano](https://rawcardano.app/) is a useful explorer tool for developers because it returns raw json results from your search, meaning it gives the results in a way that programmers can use in their programs. Created by operators from the stake pools [QXT](https://twitter.com/quixotepool) and [PIADA](https://twitter.com/Piada_stakePool).

[Blockchair](https://blockchair.com/cardano) is a "universal blockchain explorer and search engine" that works automatically with many blockchains including Cardano.

[3xpl](https://3xpl.com/cardano) is another multi-blockchain explorer that supports Cardano. It works well but lacks some features of a fully Cardano-oriented solution.
