# What is Staking?

Staking is when an ADA holder points the value of their ADA to a stake pool. Stake pools are community nodes that operate the Cardano network by producing blocks. When a stake pool receives additional staked value, it can produce blocks more often. Staking enhances Cardano's decentralization and security, and ADA users that stake receive recurring ADA rewards in return. 

Cardano has one of the simplest and safest staking mechanisms of all cryptocurrency. The staked ADA never leaves your wallet and you continue using it as usual. Rewards are distributed every 5 days.  

To begin staking: 
1. Find a stake pool that you like using a [stake pool explorer]().
2. Go to the Staking section of your wallet and select the pool. Sign a transaction that delegates the wallet's ADA toward that stake pool.  
3. Receive ADA rewards every epoch, which is 5 days.
