# What is Staking?

Staking is when an ADA holder points the value of their ADA to a stake pool. Stake pools are community nodes that produce blocks all over the world, ensuring Cardano's operation and decentralization. When a user delegates to a stake pool then the pool can produce blocks more often. In return for this service users receive recurring ADA rewards. 

Cardano has one of the simplest and safest staking mechanisms of all cryptocurrency. The staked ADA never leaves your wallet and you continue using it as usual. Rewards are distributed every 5 days.  

To begin staking: 
1. Find a stake pool that you like using a [stake pool explorer]().
2. Go to the Staking section of your wallet and select the pool. Sign a transaction that delegates the wallet's ADA toward that stake pool.  
3. Receive ADA rewards every epoch, which is 5 days.
