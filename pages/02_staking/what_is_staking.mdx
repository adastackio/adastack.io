# What is Staking?

Staking is when an ADA holder delegates the value of ADA in their wallet to a Stake Pool to support the security of the Cardano network and earn rewards in return. The value of this staked ADA helps secure the network.

Cardano has one of the simplest and safest staking mechanisms in all of cryptocurrency. Rewards are distributed every 5 days. The ADA never leaves your wallet and remains available to use. 

To begin staking: 
1. Find a stake pool that you like using a [stake pool explorer]().
2. Go to the Staking section of your wallet and select your chosen stake pool. Sign a transaction that points your ADA to that staking pool. 
3. Receive ADA rewards every 5 days.
