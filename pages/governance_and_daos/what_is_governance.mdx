# What is Cardano Governance?

Cardano aims to build a unique and secure way for people to have a say in its future. They're creating a system where everyone's voice matters, allowing people to influence how the platform grows and the projects it supports. Through voting, Cardano ensures a democratic approach, making it a community-driven space that values transparency, security, and the power of each individual's contribution. It's about giving everyone a role in shaping Cardano's journey.

## Voltaire

Voltaire introduces a robust mechanism for community-driven decision-making. Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) and Funding Proposals (FPs) are key components of this process. These mechanisms enable the Cardano community to make impactful choices regarding software updates, technical enhancements, and funding allocations. Together, these proposals empower the community to actively shape the future of Cardano, leveraging resources from the platform's treasury to realize their visions. This collaborative approach underscores Cardano's commitment to fostering a decentralized and inclusive governance model.
