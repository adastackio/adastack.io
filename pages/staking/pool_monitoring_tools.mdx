# Stake Pool Monitoring Tools

Monitoring tools help Cardano stake pool operators (SPOs) track and improve their pools' performance.

## Prometheus and Grafana

Prometheus and Grafana work together to capture and visualize stake pool metrics on Cardano. This combo is the most common way to monitor Cardano stake pools. Prometheus monitors node performance, and grafana visualizes it in an interactive dashboard. Both are in active development and supported by up-to-date documentation.

Note that Grafana Cloud is free to use if the usage of metrics is low enough (almost always the case for Cardano stake pools). Grafana also provides notifications with their [OnCall service](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/oncall/).

## Other Stake Pool Monitoring Tools

Please note that these tools might no longer be in development. Exposing Stake Pool metrics should be done with care, DYOR.
