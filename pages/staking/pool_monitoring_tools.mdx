# Stake Pool Monitoring Tools
Stake pools require ongoing monitoring to ensure they are always performing well. These tools help stake pool operators (SPOs) manage, troubleshoot, and optimize their pools on Cardano.

### Monitoring your Stake Pool independently

Although a bit time-consuming to setup initially, an independent solution to monitoring key metrics for your Stake Pool is something to be . Cardano-node outputs a number of useful metrics to Prometheus, and these can be captured and visualized via Grafana. 

Both Prometheus and Grafana are very powerful tool stacks in active development, supported by easy-to-follow and up-to-date documentation.

Note that Grafana Cloud is free to use if the number of metrics is low enough. This is almost always the case for a Cardano Stake Pool. The on-call stack is also very helpful.

### Third Party tools

Please note that these tools might no longer be in development. Exposing Stake Pool metrics should be done with care, DYOR.
