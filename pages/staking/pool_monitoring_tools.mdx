# Stake Pool Monitoring Tools

Stake pools benefit from ongoing monitoring to ensure they always perform well. These tools help stake pool operators (SPOs) manage, troubleshoot, and optimize their pools on Cardano.

### Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

Prometheus and Grafana combined is the primary way to way to capture and visualize stake pool metrics on Cardano.

**Prometheus** is a data tool that gathers and stores metrics from Cardano nodes including performance, network status, and system resources. 

**Grafana** is a visualization platform that creates interactive dashboards using the data collected by Prometheus.

Both are in active development, supported by easy-to-follow and up-to-date documentation. Note that Grafana Cloud is free to use if the number of metrics is low enough. This is almost always the case for a Cardano Stake Pool. Grafana also provides notification features with their OnCall service.

### Other Monitoring Tools

Please note that these tools might no longer be in development. Exposing Stake Pool metrics should be done with care, DYOR.
