# Stake Pool Monitoring Tools

Stake pools benefit from ongoing monitoring to ensure they always perform well. These tools help stake pool operators (SPOs) manage, troubleshoot, and optimize their pools on Cardano.

### Prometheus and Grafana Stake Pool Monitoring

Prometheus and Grafana combined is the primary way to way to capture and visualize stake pool metrics on Cardano.

**Prometheus** is a data tool that gathers and stores metrics from Cardano nodes including performance, network status, and system resources. 

**Grafana** is a visualization platform that creates interactive dashboards using the data collected by Prometheus.

Both are in active development, supported by easy-to-follow and up-to-date documentation. Note that Grafana Cloud is free to use if the number of metrics is low enough. This is almost always the case for a Cardano Stake Pool. Grafana also provides notification features with their OnCall service.

### Other Stake Pool Monitoring Tools

Please note that these tools might no longer be in development. Exposing Stake Pool metrics should be done with care, DYOR.

- [RT View](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/blob/master/cardano-tracer/docs/cardano-rtview.md/) <OSS repoURL="https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/blob/master/cardano-tracer/docs/cardano-rtview.md" />: RTView is an optional part of cardano-tracer service. It is a real-time monitoring tool for Cardano nodes (RTView is an abbreviation for "Real Time View"). It provides an interactive web page where you can see different kinds of information about connected nodes.

- [Nview](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/nview) <OSS repoURL="https://github.com/blinklabs-io/nview" />: Provides a TUI (terminal user interface) of a running node from the command line.

- [Koios gLiveView](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/monitoring-gliveview/): A script that displays live information about the node and the network, such as CPU usage, memory usage, slot number, epoch number, block height, and peers. It also shows the status of the stake pool, such as active stake, live stake, rewards, and performance.

- [Cardano Light Tools](https://github.com/orpheus-antpool/cardano-light-tools) <OSS repoURL="https://github.com/orpheus-antpool/cardano-light-tools" />: Provides a simple monitoring script that logs relevant metrics directly into a text file in human-readable form.
- 
- [Cardano Node Audit](https://github.com/Kirael12/cardano-node-audit) <OSS repoURL="https://github.com/Kirael12/" />: CLI Tool to check the health of a stake pool.

- [Jormanager](https://bitbucket.org/muamw10/jormanager/wiki/Home) <OSS repoURL="https://bitbucket.org/muamw10/jormanager/" />

- [Pool.vet](https://pool.vet/): Website to check if your Cardano stake pool is working and identify issues.
