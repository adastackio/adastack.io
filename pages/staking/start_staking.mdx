# Start Staking on Cardano 

Cardano has the most flexible staking mechanism in crypto. When you stake your ADA it never leaves your wallet. There is no lockup, no minimum staking requirement, and no penalty risk. In short, you retain full custody of your staked ADA and can spend it anytime. 

To begin staking: 
1. Find a stake pool that you like using a [stake pool explorer]().
2. Select that pool in the Staking section of your wallet. Sign a transaction to delegate your ADA to that pool.
3. Earn rewards every epoch (5 days).

## Steps to Start Staking 
<Steps>
### Choose a Stake Pool

There are over 3000 stake pools active on Cardano. It is recommended to find a pool with a good track record and good reputation in the community. To stay competitive, stake pools often offer additional benefits like supporting charitable causes or distributing other tokens in addition to ADA.

[Stake Pool Explorers](): Websites where you can browse all Cardano stake pools and see their stats.  

[Mission Driven Pools](https://missiondrivenpools.org/member-pools/): This website highlights pools with a positive mission. It's a great resource to find pools that align with your interests.

### Confirm Delegation in your Wallet

Once you've selected a stake pool you can make your delegation offical on the Cardano network. Go to the Staking section of your wallet and find your chosen pool. Click "Stake" and sign a transaction that delegates the wallet's ADA toward that stake pool.  

### Receive Staking Rewards

Once your delegation is confirmed, you will earn your first rewards in 10 to 15 days. After that, staking rewards are paid every 5 days and compound automatically.

Rewards are visible in your Cardano wallet or using a [reward tracker website](). Before you can spend your staking rewards you must click "Withdraw Rewards" in your wallet and sign a transaction.

## Other things to know
- [More than 60%](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/p_5eaybb3cqc?s=huXqeQmi9qA) of ADA is staked on Cardano. Staking is an essential mechanism for maintaining the decentralization and security of the network.
- To improve the decentralization of the Cardano network you can consider staking with a single stake pool. The [Single Pool Alliance](https://singlepoolalliance.net/) lists many committed single stake pools. 
- It is a good idea to check your [stake pool's stats]() from time to time to make sure they are still producing blocks consistently. Stake pools can shut down or update their fees. If you want to change to a different pool it's easy to switch to another stake pool anytime from your wallet.  
- Using the [Lace Wallet](https://www.lace.io/) or [Atrium](https://www.atrium.io/) platform, it is possible to stake to multiple pools from a single wallet. This is useful when you want to support multiple pools and diversify your rewards.
