# What is Staking on Cardano?

## What is Staking?
Cardano is a Proof of Stake network. This means that security of the network is provided by users delegating their ADA to block-producing nodes known as stake pools. The collective value of this staked ADA helps to safeguard and decentralize the network by making it prohibitively expensive to attack Cardano. 

Cardano has one of the simplest staking mechanisms in all of cryptocurrency. To use it: find a stake pool you like, and sign a transaction that points the value of your ADA to that staking pool. Your ADA is still in your wallet and freely spendable. As a reward for this participation you'll receive ADA payouts every 5 days. 

## Choosing a Stake Pool
There are thousands of stake pools active on Cardano, though their rates of return vary quite a lot based on their performance, the amount that's been staked to them, and other factors. Staking is a very competitive landscape, so it is good to look around and find one you like and that has a good track record.

## Start Staking
There are just a few steps to get started:
1. Set up a Cardano Wallet: First, you need to have a Cardano wallet that supports staking. 
2. Transfer ADA to your Wallet: Once you have a Cardano wallet, you'll need to transfer some ADA (Cardano's native cryptocurrency) to your wallet. 
3. Choose a stake pool to delegate to: This is a competitive landscape. Some stake pools offer higher rewards, support charity initiatives, or reward delegators with other tokens or NFTs. You may also find it helpful to look at some [stake pool explorers]() to find a stake pool you like.  
4. Confirm Delegation: After you've selected a stake pool you will need to sign a transaction that confirms your delegation to that stake pool. 
5. Start Earning Rewards: Once your delegation transaction is confirmed, you are ready to start earning staking rewards.

## Other things to know
- It takes between 10 to 15 days to earn your first rewards, as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI-cN3itXVo) and [this article](https://medium.com/@cryptofay/When-will-i-get-cardano-staking-rewards-timeline-55db6c077caa). After that, rewards will be added to your wallet every epoch (every 5 days) and compound automatically.
- Cardano has the most flexible staking mechanism in crypto. When you stake your tokens they never leave your wallet and can be spent freely. There is no lockup period, no minimum staking requirement, and no slashing risk. Due to these factors, Cardano has an impressive 65%+ staked, which contributes to the decentralization and security of the network.
- To improve the decentralization of the Cardano network it is recommended to stake with a single stake pool, rather than a multi-pool entity or a crypto exchange. The [Single Pool Alliance's website](https://singlepoolalliance.net/) lists many stake pools that have committed to owning just one stake pool. Here are some [current metrics](https://cexplorer.io/groups) showing the percentage of users staked to a single pool. 
- Occasionally stake pools shut down, so it is a good idea to check on your stake pool from time to time to make sure they are still producing blocks consistently. 
- To help raise money to fund a project, sometimes Cardano projects use a unique fundraising method called an ISPO (initial stake pool offering). When using this method, the project sets up a special stake pool that gives them a large portion of the ADA rewards, and in return rewards their delegators with their project token instead. You can see some websites that track ISPOs currently available [here](). 
- It is possible to stake to multiple pools from a single wallet. You can use the multiple delegation feature of the [Lace Wallet](https://www.lace.io/) or the staking baskets offered by [Atrium]().
