# Start Staking on Cardano 

Staking is an important contributor to the security and decentralization of the Cardano network. It also allows you to earn ADA rewards every 5 days. 

## Steps to Start Staking 
<Steps>
### Choose a Stake Pool

There are over 3000 stake pools active on Cardano. To maximize your rewards it is recommended to find a pool that you trust and with a good track record. Some stake pools offer additional benefits like distributing other tokens on top of ADA rewards, supporting charitable causes, or optimizing their pool to maximize rewards.

[Stake Pool Explorers]() are tools where you can see all Cardano stake pools and assess their performance. 

[Stake Pool Alliances]() are groups of pools that share a common cause. Use these to find a pool that align with your values and interests.

### Confirm Delegation in your Wallet

After you've selected a stake pool you like, you must sign a transaction to make it official on the network. First, open your Cardano wallet and find the "Staking" section. Next, find your stake pool and select it. To confirm your delegation from that stake pool, sign the staking transaction using your wallet.

## Other things to know
- It takes between 10 to 15 days to earn your first rewards, as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI-cN3itXVo) and [this article](https://medium.com/@cryptofay/When-will-i-get-cardano-staking-rewards-timeline-55db6c077caa). After that, rewards are added to your wallet every epoch (5 days) and compound automatically.
- Cardano has the most flexible staking mechanism in crypto. When you stake your tokens they never leave your wallet and can be spent freely. There is no lockup period, no minimum staking requirement, and no slashing risk. Due to these factors, Cardano has an impressive 65%+ staked, which contributes to the decentralization and security of the network.
- To improve the decentralization of the Cardano network it is recommended to stake with a single stake pool, rather than a multi-pool entity or a crypto exchange. The [Single Pool Alliance](https://singlepoolalliance.net/) lists many stake pools that have committed to owning just one stake pool. Here are some [staking metrics](https://cexplorer.io/groups) showing the percentage of users staked to a single pool. 
- Occasionally stake pools shut down, so it is a good idea to check on your stake pool from time to time to make sure they are still producing blocks consistently.  
- Using the [Lace Wallet](https://www.lace.io/), it is possible to stake to multiple pools from a single account. This is useful to further decentralize the stake while supporting multiple
