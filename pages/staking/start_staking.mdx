# Get Started with Cardano Staking

### What is Staking?
Cardano is a Proof of Stake network. In this mechanism, the security of the network is provided by users delegating their ada into their chosen staking pool. This collective value of this ada helps to safeguard and decentralize the network by making it prohibitively expensive to attack the network. Cardano has one of the simplest staking mechanisms in all of cryptocurrency in which you essentially just point your wallet to a staking pool, without having to do anything else.  As a reward for this passive participation users receive payouts every 5 days.

### Steps to Stake on Cardano
Cardano has one of the simplest staking mechanisms in all of cryptocurrency. There are just a few steps to get started:
1. Set up a Cardano Wallet: First, you need to have a Cardano wallet that supports staking. 
2. Transfer ADA to your Wallet: Once you have a Cardano wallet, you'll need to transfer some ADA (Cardano's native cryptocurrency) to your wallet. 
3. Choose a stake pool to delegate to: This is a competitive landscape. Some stake pools offer higher rewards, support charity initiatives, or reward delegators with other tokens or NFTs.

<br/><br/>You may also find it helpful to look at some [stake pool explorers](./pool_explorers.mdx) to find a stake pool you like.  
4. Confirm Delegation: After you've selected a stake pool you will need to sign a transaction that confirms your delegation to that stake pool. 
5. Start Earning Rewards: Once your delegation transaction is confirmed, you are ready to start earning staking rewards. It will take between 10 to 15 days to earn your first rewards, as explained in [this article](https://medium.com/@cryptofay/When-will-i-get-cardano-staking-rewards-timeline-55db6c077caa). After that, rewards will be added to your wallet every epoch (every 5 days) and compound automatically.

### Other things to know
- Cardano has the most flexible staking mechanism in crypto. When you stake your tokens they never leave your wallet and can be spent freely. There is no lockup period, no minimum staking requirement, and no slashing risk. Due to these factors, Cardano has an impressive 65%+ staked, which contributes to the decentralization and security of the network.
- To improve the decentralization of the Cardano network it is recommended to stake with a single stake pool, rather than an entity that has multiple stake pools or a crypto exchange like Binance. The [Single Pool Alliance's website](https://singlepoolalliance.net/) lists many stake pools that have committed to operating just one stake pool. 
- Occasionally stake pools shut down, so it is a good idea to check on your stake pool from time to time to make sure they are still producing blocks consistently. 
- To help raise money to fund a project, sometimes Cardano projects use a unique fundraising method called an ISPO (initial stake pool offering). When using this method, the project sets up a special stake pool that gives them a large portion of the ADA rewards, and in return rewards their delegators with their project token instead. You can see some websites that track ISPOs currently available [here](). 
- There are methods to stake to multiple pools from a single wallet. You can use the multiple delegation feature of the [Lace Wallet](https://www.lace.io/) or the staking baskets offered by [https://atriumlab.io/].
