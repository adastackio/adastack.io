# Start Staking on Cardano 

Cardano has the most flexible staking mechanism in crypto. When you stake your ADA it never leaves your wallet. There is no lockup, no minimum staking requirement, and no penalty risk. In short, you retain full custody of your staked ADA and can spend it anytime. 

Staking is simple. To begin: 
1. Find a stake pool that you like using a [stake pool explorer]().
2. Select that pool in the Staking section of your wallet. Sign a transaction to delegate your ADA to that pool.
3. Earn rewards every epoch (5 days).

## Steps to Start Staking 
<Steps>
### Choose a Stake Pool

There are over 3000 stake pools active on Cardano. It is recommended to find a pool with a good track record and good reputation in the community. To stay competitive, stake pools often offer additional benefits for delegators like supporting charitable causes or giving delegators additional tokens besides ADA.

[Stake Pool Explorers](): Websites where you can browse all Cardano stake pools and see their stats.  

[Mission Driven Pools](https://missiondrivenpools.org/member-pools/): This website highlights pools with a positive mission. It's a great resource to find pools that align with your interests.

### Confirm Delegation in your Wallet

After you've selected a stake pool you like, you must sign a transaction to make it official on the network. Go to the Staking section of your wallet and find your chosen pool. Click "Stake" and sign a transaction that delegates the wallet's ADA toward that stake pool.  

### Receive Staking Rewards

Once your delegation is confirmed then you will earn your first rewards within 10 to 15 days, and from then on staking rewards are paid every 5 days.

Rewards are visible in your Cardano wallet or using a [reward tracker](). When you want to spend your staking rewards, you must first click to "Withdraw Rewards" in your wallet and sign a transaction.

## Other things to know
- It takes between 10 to 15 days to earn your first rewards, as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI-cN3itXVo) and [this article](https://medium.com/@cryptofay/When-will-i-get-cardano-staking-rewards-timeline-55db6c077caa). After that, rewards are added to your wallet every epoch (5 days) and compound automatically.
- Cardano has 65%+ staked, which contributes to the decentralization and security of the network.
- To improve the decentralization of the Cardano network it is recommended to stake with a single stake pool, rather than a multi-pool entity or a crypto exchange. The [Single Pool Alliance](https://singlepoolalliance.net/) lists many stake pools that have committed to owning just one stake pool. Here are some [staking metrics](https://cexplorer.io/groups) showing the percentage of users staked to a single pool. 
- Occasionally stake pools shut down, so it is a good idea to check on your stake pool from time to time to make sure they are still producing blocks consistently.  
- Using the [Lace Wallet](https://www.lace.io/), it is possible to stake to multiple pools from a single account. This is useful to further decentralize the stake while supporting multiple
