## Start Staking 
<Steps>
### Set up a Cardano Wallet
 
Download a good Cardano wallet that supports staking and set it up. Transfer some ADA to your wallet. 
 
### Choose a Stake Pool
 
Find a pool that you trust. Some stake pools offer addional benefits like additional tokens, supporting charitable causes, or enhancing their pool to maximize rewards. 

### Confirm Delegation
 
After you've selected a stake pool you will need to sign a transaction that confirms your delegation. Keep in mind that your ADA is still in your wallet and freely spendable. 

### Start Earning Rewards

Once your delegation is confirmed, you are ready to start earning staking rewards. Rewards are paid out every 5 days and can be withdrawn anytime.

## Other things to know
- It takes between 10 to 15 days to earn your first rewards, as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI-cN3itXVo) and [this article](https://medium.com/@cryptofay/When-will-i-get-cardano-staking-rewards-timeline-55db6c077caa). After that, rewards are added to your wallet every epoch (5 days) and compound automatically.
- Cardano has the most flexible staking mechanism in crypto. When you stake your tokens they never leave your wallet and can be spent freely. There is no lockup period, no minimum staking requirement, and no slashing risk. Due to these factors, Cardano has an impressive 65%+ staked, which contributes to the decentralization and security of the network.
- To improve the decentralization of the Cardano network it is recommended to stake with a single stake pool, rather than a multi-pool entity or a crypto exchange. The [Single Pool Alliance's website](https://singlepoolalliance.net/) lists many stake pools that have committed to owning just one stake pool. Here are some [staking metrics](https://cexplorer.io/groups) showing the percentage of users staked to a single pool. 
- Occasionally stake pools shut down, so it is a good idea to check on your stake pool from time to time to make sure they are still producing blocks consistently. 
- To help raise money to fund a project, sometimes Cardano projects use a unique fundraising method called an ISPO (initial stake pool offering). When using this method, the project sets up a special stake pool that gives them a large portion of the ADA rewards, and in return rewards their delegators with their project token instead. You can see some websites that track ISPOs currently available [here](). 
- It is possible to stake to multiple pools from a single wallet. You can use the multiple delegation feature of the [Lace Wallet](https://www.lace.io/) or the staking baskets offered by [Atrium]().
