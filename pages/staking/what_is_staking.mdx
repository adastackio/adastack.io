# What is Staking?

Staking is when an ADA holder points or delegates the value of their ADA to a stake pool. As the stake pool receives more ADA delegation it increases their probability producing new blocks. When a stake pool mints a new block they are rewarded with ADA which is automatically distributed between the stake pool owners and their delegators.

The purpose of staking is to maintain the security and operation of Cardano. Cardano's rules are enforced by a consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. Staking is an essential component of Ouroboros because it makes the Cardano network dynamic and expensive to attack. [Read more here](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/consensus-explained).

Cardano's staking mechanism is one of the simplest and safest in cryptocurrency. Staked ADA never leaves a user's wallet so it always remains in their full control. Staking rewards are distributed every 5 days.
