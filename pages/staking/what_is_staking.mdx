# What is Staking?

Staking is a way of securing and operating a blockchain network by holding a stake (or value) in the system. Cardano uses a staking system called Ouroboros, which is the first proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol to be based on peer-reviewed research and formal methods. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) protocols, which require miners to use a lot of energy and computing power to solve complex problems, Ouroboros selects validators randomly and proportionally to their stake. This means that anyone who owns ada, the native cryptocurrency of Cardano, can participate in the network and earn rewards. Validators do not compete with each other, but cooperate to produce blocks and confirm transactions.
Ouroboros has several advantages over PoW protocols, such as:

- security: Ouroboros is mathematically proven to be secure against attacks, as long as the majority of the stake is controlled by honest actors.
- efficiency: Ouroboros consumes much less energy and resources than PoW, making it more environmentally friendly and sustainable.
- performance: Ouroboros can achieve higher scalability and throughput than PoW, enabling faster and cheaper transactions.
- inclusiveness: Ouroboros allows anyone to join the network and contribute to its governance, regardless of their technical skills orÂ availability.

# What are Stake Pools?
Stake pools are typically managed by either an individual or a collective of operators who facilitate the staking process for cryptocurrency holders. By pooling together various amounts of crypto from participants, these pools contribute to the blockchain's stability and functionality by actively validating transactions. This approach provides a convenient option for individuals who prefer not to manage their own pools, allowing them to delegate their crypto holdings to the pool and earn staking rewards without the hassle of maintenance, which is efficiently handled by the pool operators.

# What are Staking Rewards?
Staking rewards are incentives provided to individuals who delegate their cryptocurrency holdings to a staking pool, thereby contributing to the operational integrity of the blockchain network. By participating in staking, individuals actively support the network's functions, such as transaction validation and consensus maintenance, for which they receive compensation. In the case of Cardano, staking ADA does not entail locking up the cryptocurrency, affording participants the flexibility to withdraw their funds at any time. This stands in contrast to other blockchain platforms where staked assets are typically locked for a specified period.
