# What is Staking?

Staking is a way of securing and operating a blockchain network by holding a stake (or value) in the system. Cardano uses a staking system called Ouroboros, which is the first proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol to be based on peer-reviewed research and formal methods. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) protocols, which require miners to use a lot of energy and computing power to solve complex problems, Ouroboros selects validators randomly and proportionally to their stake. This means that anyone who owns ada, the native cryptocurrency of Cardano, can participate in the network and earn rewards. Validators do not compete with each other, but cooperate to produce blocks and confirm transactions.
Ouroboros has several advantages over PoW protocols, such as:

- security: Ouroboros is mathematically proven to be secure against attacks, as long as the majority of the stake is controlled by honest actors.
- efficiency: Ouroboros consumes much less energy and resources than PoW, making it more environmentally friendly and sustainable.
- performance: Ouroboros can achieve higher scalability and throughput than PoW, enabling faster and cheaper transactions.
- inclusiveness: Ouroboros allows anyone to join the network and contribute to its governance, regardless of their technical skills orÂ availability.
