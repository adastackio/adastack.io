# What is Staking?

Staking is when an ADA holder points or delegates the value of their ADA to a stake pool. As the stake pool receives ADA delegation it increases their probability of producing new blocks. Every time a stake pool mints a new block they are rewarded with some ADA that is automatically distributed between the stake pool owners and their delegators (based on the rules set by the pool).

The overall purpose of staking is to maintain the operation and security of Cardano. Staking aligns incentives in a way that encourages Cardano's decentralization and makes the system dynamic and incredibly expensive to attack. Staking is a key feature of Cardano's consensus mechanism (the rules of the network) called Ouroboros. [Read more here](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/consensus-explained).

Cardano's staking mechanism is one of the simplest and safest in cryptocurrency. Staked ADA never leaves a user's wallet so it always remains in their full control. Staking rewards are distributed every 5 days.
