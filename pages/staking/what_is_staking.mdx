# What is Staking?
Staking is a way to help run a blockchain network by holding a stake, or value, in the system. Instead of using a lot of energy like traditional methods, Cardano's staking system, called Ouroboros, works by randomly selecting validators based on how much cryptocurrency they own. These validators work together to confirm transactions and produce blocks, earning rewards in the process. Ouroboros is considered secure, efficient, and inclusive because it's been mathematically proven to be secure, consumes less energy, allows for faster transactions, and lets anyone join and contribute to the network, regardless of technical skills.

# What are Stake Pools?
Stake pools are typically managed by either an individual or a collective of operators who facilitate the staking process for cryptocurrency holders. By pooling together various amounts of crypto from participants, these pools contribute to the blockchain's stability and functionality by actively validating transactions. This approach provides a convenient option for individuals who prefer not to manage their own pools, allowing them to delegate their crypto holdings to the pool and earn staking rewards without the hassle of maintenance, which is efficiently handled by the pool operators.

# What are Staking Rewards?
Staking rewards are incentives provided to individuals who delegate their cryptocurrency holdings to a staking pool, thereby contributing to the operational integrity of the blockchain network. By participating in staking, individuals actively support the network's functions, such as transaction validation and consensus maintenance, for which they receive compensation. In the case of Cardano, staking ADA does not entail locking up the cryptocurrency, affording participants the flexibility to withdraw their funds at any time. This stands in contrast to other blockchain platforms where staked assets are typically locked for a specified period.
