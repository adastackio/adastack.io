# What is Staking?

Staking is when an ADA holder points or delegates the value of their ADA to a stake pool. Stake pools are community nodes that produce blocks for Cardano. When a stake pool receives additional ADA delegation it improves their odds of producing blocks. When a stake pool creates a block both the stake pool and its delegators receive rewards.

Cardano has one of the simplest and safest staking mechanisms in all of cryptocurrency. ADA that is staked never leave the wallet and is in the holder's full control. Rewards from staking are distributed every 5 days.
