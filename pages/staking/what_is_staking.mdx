# What is Staking?

Staking is when an ADA holder points or delegates the value of their ADA to a stake pool. As the stake pool receives more ADA delegation their probability of producing blocks increases. When a block is created the stake pool is rewarded with a block reward of ADA. This reward is shared between the stake pool operators and the pool's delegators.

The overall purpose of staking is to maintain the security and operation of Cardano. Specifically, Cardano's rules are enforced by a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroborous. [Read more here](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/consensus-explained).

Cardano's staking mechanism is one of the simplest and safest in cryptocurrency. Staked ADA never leaves the user's wallet and always remains in their full control. Staking rewards are distributed every 5 days.
