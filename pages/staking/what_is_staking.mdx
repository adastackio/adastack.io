# What is Staking?

Staking is when an ADA holder points or delegates the value of their ADA to a stake pool. Stake pools with higher amounts of ADA delegation have an greater chance to produce blocks on Cardano. When a stake pool makes a new block, the pool is rewarded with newly minted ADA that is shared between the stake pool operators and the pool's delegators.

The overall purpose of this is to maintain Cardano's security and operation using Cardano's Ouroborous proof-of-stake consensus method. [Read more here](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/consensus-explained).

Cardano's staking mechanism is one of the simplest and safest in cryptocurrency. Staked ADA never leaves the user's wallet and remains in their full control. Staking rewards are distributed every 5 days.
