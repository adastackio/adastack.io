# What is Staking?

Cardano is a "Proof of Stake" system. In this system, the security of the network is provided by users delegating their ADA stake pools, which produce blocks on the Cardano blockchain. The collective value of this staked ADA helps to safeguard and decentralize the network by making it prohibitively expensive to attack Cardano. 

Cardano has one of the simplest staking mechanisms in all of cryptocurrency. To use it: find a stake pool you like, and sign a transaction that points the value of your ADA to that staking pool. Your ADA is still in your wallet and freely spendable. As a reward for this participation you'll receive ADA payouts every 5 days.
