# Funded Proposals

Adastack is still in development. Please [vote for us](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/119612) in Catalyst Fund 12 to support our growth. We seek to provide the Cardano community with an open-source, continuously updated, SEO-ready library of Cardano tools and resources.

### Website Features:

- **Comprehensive** — The site has 100+ resource pages. As content gets added to every page there will be thousands of resources on the site (each page will start with 5 to 50+ items). Here's a demo resource page for [Blockchain Explorers](https://www.adastack.io/on_chain/blockchain_explorers) to get an idea of how resource page will look.

- **Carefully Organized** — The website will start with 14 main categories that collectively encompass nearly all of the Cardano ecosystem. Each category is divided into several pages. To see the categories visit [adastack.io](https://adastack.io) and look through the navigation menu. The site's architecture is flexibly designed so the site can grow and adapt as new areas of Cardano emerge.

- **Open-Source** — Adastack.io is fully [open-source](https://github.com/adastackio/adastack.io) under the [MIT license](https://github.com/adastackio/adastack.io/blob/main/LICENSE), meaning anyone can view, copy, or suggest modifications to the code. We aim to to provide a positive contribution to the Cardano community, and engage with their ideas, feedback, knowledge to continue advancing the website. Open-source contributions helps ensure the content stays accurate, relevant, and up-to-date.

- **Fast** — The website is designed for speed, utilizing a popular and modern technology stack of React, Next.js, Tailwind, Markdown, and Git/Github. It also uses the [Nextra theme](https://nextra.site/), which is favored for large documentation websites. Nextra is used by projects within the Cardano ecosystem such as [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/fundamentals/getting-started) and [Demeter.run](https://docs.demeter.run/). This theme is ideal for Adastack as it offers optimized search, simple navigation, excellent readability, and a method to suggest contributions to any page easily.

- **SEO Optimized** — The site's content is crafted to be easily understood by search engines, improving its chances of ranking well. We incorporate on-page best practices, like custom meta-titles and meta-descriptions for each page to boost search engine visibility. Furthermore, the site's content will be automatically re-submitted to Google after every code update to ensure the freshest content is always indexed. Prioritizing SEO helps improve the results for queries about Cardano, on both search engines and AI LLMs like ChatGPT.

- **Quickly Searchable** — Adastack uses FlexSearch, a search tool that indexes all of the site's content ahead of time so that it can provide real-time search results in the website's search bar.

- **Open metrics** — To assess the site's impact over time I set up a privacy-focused analytics service called Plausible to collect anonymous metrics on visitors, to gauge site performance and engagement over time. The metrics are publicly available on the site's [Plausible dashboard](https://plausible.io/adastack.io).

- **Onboarding Guides** — The website features over 10 guides designed to educate newcomers about foundational Cardano topics and help them integrate into the ecosystem. These guides are written in a simple manner, assuming no prior knowledge, and cover essential educational topics such as [What is Blockchain](https://www.adastack.io/intro_to_cardano/what_is_blockchain), [Why Cardano](https://www.adastack.io/intro_to_cardano/why_cardano), [Start Using Cardano](https://www.adastack.io/intro_to_cardano/start_using_cardano), [How to Start Staking](https://www.adastack.io/staking/how_to_start_staking), and more.

- **Encourages Contributions** — Each page on the site features an "edit this page" button, directing users to the GitHub web interface to submit contribution suggestions. This straightforward process welcomes all users, regardless of technical expertise, to enhance the site by adding resources or updating content. If this proposal receives funding, I will create a Guide to Contributing with written instructions and a video guide to assist potential contributors step-by-step.

- **Responsive** — The site adapts to different screen sizes including desktops, tablets, phones, and others to ensure it can be used on any device.

- **Niche Categorization** — Resources are organized into precise and refined categories to assist people searching for specific items. For instance, rather than a general category such as "Cardano Social Media," there are multiple refined categories like "YouTube", "Twitter", "Podcasts", "Newsletters", "Forums and Reddit", and "Telegram". This is beneficial for SEO because if someone is searching for something specific in Google (ex. "Cardano newsletters") they can find a page that exactly corresponds to their search.

- **Long-term Vision:** - I view this project as a long-term endeavor where I can work on something I enjoy while also making a positive impact on Cardano. Even after the conclusion of this Catalyst agreement, I plan to keep maintaining, enhancing, and expanding the project over time. Regardless of my involvement, the site can be continued or repurposed by anyone since it is open source.
