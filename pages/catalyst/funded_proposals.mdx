# Funded Proposals

Adastack is still in development. Please [vote for us](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/119612) in Catalyst Fund 12 to support our growth. We seek to provide the Cardano community with an open-source, continuously updated, SEO-ready library of Cardano tools and resources.

### Website Features:

- **Comprehensive** — The site has 100+ resource pages. We are continually adding content to each page. Once the initial content is added there will be thousands of resources on the site (each page will start with 5 to 50+ items). Here's a demo resource page for [Blockchain Explorers](https://www.adastack.io/on_chain/blockchain_explorers) to get an idea of how a resource page looks.

- **Carefully Organized** — The website will start with 14 main categories that collectively encompass nearly all of the Cardano ecosystem. Each category is divided into several or dozens of pages. To see the 14 categories visit [adastack.io](https://adastack.io) and look through the menu. The site's architecture is flexibly designed so the site can grow and adapt as new areas of Cardano emerge.

- **Open-Source** — Adastack.io is fully [open-source](https://github.com/adastackio/adastack.io) under the [MIT license](https://github.com/adastackio/adastack.io/blob/main/LICENSE), allowing anyone can view, copy, or suggest modifications to the code. We aim to to provide a positive contribution to the Cardano community, and engage with their ideas, feedback, and knowledge to continue advancing the website. Open-source contributions help ensure the content stays accurate, relevant, and up-to-date.

- **Fast** — The website is designed for speed, utilizing a popular and modern technology stack of React, Next.js, Tailwind, Markdown, and Git/Github. It also uses the [Nextra theme](https://nextra.site/), which is favored for large documentation websites. Nextra is used by projects within the Cardano ecosystem such as [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/fundamentals/getting-started) and [Demeter.run](https://docs.demeter.run/). This theme is ideal for Adastack as it offers optimized search, simple navigation, excellent readability, and a method to suggest contributions to any page easily.

- **SEO Optimized** — The site's content is optimized for search engines, increasing its chances of ranking well. Custom meta-titles and meta-descriptions are crafted for each page to boost search engine visibility. Furthermore, the site's content will be automatically re-submitted to Google after every code update to ensure the latest content is always indexed. Prioritizing the site's SEO should help improve search results about Cardano, on both search engines and AI LLMs like ChatGPT.

- **Quickly Searchable** — Adastack uses FlexSearch, a search tool that pre-indexes all content for real-time search results in the website's search bar..

- **Open metrics** — To assess the site's impact over time I set up a privacy-focused analytics service called Plausible to collect anonymous metrics on visitors, to gauge site performance and engagement over time. The metrics are publicly available on the site's [Plausible Dashboard](https://plausible.io/adastack.io).

- **Onboarding Guides** — The website features over 10 guides designed to educate newcomers about foundational Cardano topics and help them integrate into the ecosystem. These guides cover essential topics such as [What is Blockchain?](https://www.adastack.io/intro_to_cardano/what_is_blockchain), [Why Cardano?](https://www.adastack.io/intro_to_cardano/why_cardano), [Start Using Cardano](https://www.adastack.io/intro_to_cardano/start_using_cardano), [How to Start Staking](https://www.adastack.io/staking/how_to_start_staking), and more.

- **Contributions Encouraged** — Each page on the site features an "edit this page" button, directing users to the GitHub web interface to submit contribution suggestions. This straightforward process welcomes all users, regardless of technical expertise, to enhance the site by adding resources or updating content. If this proposal receives funding, I will create a Guide to Contributing with written instructions and a video guide to assist potential contributors step-by-step.

- **Responsive** — The site is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on desktops, tablets, phones, and other devices.

- **Niche Categorization** — Resources are organized into precise and refined categories to assist people searching for specific items. For instance, rather than a general category such as "Cardano Social Media," there are multiple refined categories like "YouTube", "Twitter", "Podcasts", "Newsletters", "Forums and Reddit", and "Telegram". This is beneficial for SEO because if someone is searching for something specific in Google (ex. "Cardano newsletters") they can find a page that exactly corresponds to their search.

- **Long-term Vision** — I view this project as a long-term experiment where I can work on something I enjoy, learn about Cardano and open-source, and simultaneously make a positive impact on Cardano. Even after the conclusion of this Catalyst agreement, I plan to keep maintaining, enhancing, and expanding the project over time. Regardless of my involvement, the site can be continued or repurposed by anyone since it is open-source.
