# What is Project Catalyst?

[Project Catalyst](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/) is a collective innovation fund for Cardano. The fund holds regular rounds in which projects can apply for funding to build something beneficial on Cardano. Once the proposals submitted, ADA-holders vote on which ones to fund. Catalyst is sustainably funded using the [Cardano treasury](https://cexplorer.io/pot).

Catalyst is very community-driven. Community members give feedback on proposals, vote on proposals, and provide accountability for funded projects by reviewing their milestones. Users that engage in Catalyst are incentivized by ADA rewards from the Cardano treasury.
