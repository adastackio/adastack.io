# What is Project Catalyst?
Project Catalyst stands as a pioneering decentralized innovation platform within the Cardano blockchain. Operating as a crowd-sourced incubator, it fosters collaboration among a diverse community of innovators committed to addressing real-world challenges on the Cardano Blockchain.

# Funding Rounds and Community Involvement
In each funding round, the community articulates challenges, met with project proposals from individuals eager to provide solutions. The distinguishing factor of Catalyst lies in its unwavering commitment to decentralization, with the community actively participating in the selection process through democratic voting. This ensures an inclusive and transparent decision-making approach.

# Impacts and Achievements
With an indelible mark, Project Catalyst has allocated over $66 million to 1466+ projects. It is not merely a funding mechanism; it operates as an innovation engine, empowering the global community to transform ideas into reality on the Cardano platform.

# Inclusivity Across Expertise Levels
Whether you're an experienced developer, a blockchain enthusiast, or a newcomer to the industry, Catalyst invites you to be part of the community. It encourages individuals to contribute their ideas and collaboratively build towards a decentralized and impactful future.

# Rewards System
Project Catalyst goes beyond funding projects; it rewards community members actively participating in the project selection process. A fixed set of ADA is allocated for voting rewards, distributed based on the amount of ADA owned. This dual-incentive system encourages active engagement in shaping the Cardano ecosystem.

# Source of Funding
The funds for Project Catalyst originate from a fixed set of ADA allocated to the platform from the Cardano Treasury. This allocation occurs during each funding round, ensuring a sustainable financial model.

# Operational Cycle
Project Catalyst conducts funding rounds every few months, with a predetermined amount of ADA ready to allocate to innovative ideas. At the start of each fund, the community has a three-week window to submit proposals addressing challenges set in the previous funding round. Proposals undergo community voting, and funding is allocated to the selected projects.
