# What is a Dapp?

A dapp is a distributed application that operates on a peer-to-peer network of nodes, such as a blockchain, rather than a centralized server. A dapp can have a front-end interface and a back-end logic, but the back-end logic is executed by the network nodes, not by a single entity. A dapp is typically open source, transparent, and incentivized by cryptographic tokens. So in essence A Dapp is not controlled by a single entity but by the entire blockchainÂ nodes.
