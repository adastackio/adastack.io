# What is a Dapp?

A decentralized application, or Dapp, is any application that runs on a blockchain network. The Dapp can execute logic and make transactions on the blockchain using a smart contract. Smart contract are pieces of unchangable code forged the Cardano blockchain that execute once conditions are met. Dapps provide services and utilities within the Cardano economy. Because of open the nature of blockhain, all Cardano users should enjoy equal access when using decentralized applications. 

## Common Types of DApps

1. Decentralized Exchange (DEX): Facilitates peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies, eliminating intermediaries to offer users greater autonomy and transparency in transactions.

2. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Offering a comprehensive suite of financial services such as lending, borrowing, and staking, DeFi operates directly on the blockchain, bypassing traditional financial institutions and empowering users with greater control over their assets.

3. Storage and Computing: Leveraging distributed networks, dApps utilize decentralized storage and computing resources, ensuring heightened security, scalability, and cost-effectiveness compared to centralized alternatives.

4. Payments and E-commerce: Enabling seamless cryptocurrency transactions and facilitating online commerce, these dApps ensure faster, more secure transactions while reducing fees associated with traditional payment methods.

5. Privacy: Employing cryptographic techniques and decentralized protocols, dApps safeguard user data and ensure transaction anonymity, prioritizing user privacy in an increasingly digitized world.

6. Signing and Verification: Implementing tamper-proof mechanisms for document signing and data verification, dApps foster trust and transparency in digital interactions, enhancing the integrity of online transactions.

7. Supply Chain: Tracking the movement of goods and materials via transparent and secure blockchain technology, supply chain dApps ensure authenticity and optimize logistical processes.

8. Social Media: Empowering users with ownership of their data and interactions, censorship-resistant social media dApps redefine online communities, fostering transparency and user autonomy.

9. Gaming: Integrating blockchain technology for unique gaming experiences, ownership of in-game assets, and secure virtual economies, gaming dApps revolutionize the gaming industry by offering players unprecedented control and ownership.

10. Governance: Facilitating community-driven decision-making in organizations and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), governance dApps redefine traditional organizational structures.

11. Identity Management: Offering secure and self-sovereign control over personal data, identity management dApps empower individuals with greater autonomy and privacy protection.

12. The Internet of Things (IoT): Managing and connecting devices on a decentralized network, IoT dApps ensure secure and transparent data exchange, laying the foundation for a more interconnected and digitized future.
