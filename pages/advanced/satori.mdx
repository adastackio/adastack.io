# Satori

Satori (悟り) is a Japanese Buddhist term for awakening, "comprehension; understanding".

With repeated practice, code challenge websites are a great way to become a more skillful and versatile programmer. Many teach advanced concepts like data structures and algorithms. They are also useful for preparing for interviews and showing off your skills to potential employers.

Here are some of my favorites:
