# Intro to Cardano Development

Cardano development is the process of writing code that interacts with the Cardano blockchain. Cardano supports development in multiple programming languages like Haskell, Plutus, Aiken and JavaScript/TypeScript, enabling creation of smart contracts, decentralized applications, infrastructure tools and more to advance the Cardano blockchain.

### Areas of Focus in Cardano Development

- __Smart Contract Development__: Using languages like Plutus and Marlowe, developers can create smart contracts for decentralized applications (DApps) and automate transactions and agreements on the Cardano blockchain.

- __DApp Development__: Building decentralized applications on Cardano allows developers to create a wide range of applications spanning industries such as finance, supply chain management, gaming, voting systems, and more.

- __Protocol Development__: Cardano is an open-source project, and developers can contribute to its core protocol by proposing and implementing improvements, new features, and enhancements.

- __Wallet Development__: Developers can build wallets that allow users to securely store, send, and receive ADA and interact with decentralized applications and smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.

- __Infrastructure Development__: Creating tools and infrastructure such as blockchain explorers, node software, and other developer resources that facilitate interaction with the Cardano blockchain.

- __Research and Academic Contributions__: Given Cardano's emphasis on peer-reviewed research and formal methods, developers can contribute to advancing blockchain technology by conducting research, publishing papers, and participating in academic discussions.

- __Governance and Voting Systems__: Developers can also contribute to the development of governance mechanisms and voting systems on Cardano, which enable stakeholders to participate in the decision-making process regarding protocol upgrades and other matters.

- __Integration with Existing Systems__: Integrating Cardano's blockchain technology into existing systems and applications to enhance security, transparency, and efficiency in various domains such as identity management, supply chain tracking, and digital asset tokenization
