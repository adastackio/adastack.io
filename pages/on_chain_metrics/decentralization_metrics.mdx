# Decentralization Metrics

Blockchains rely on decentralization to maintain long-term resilience and security. By distributing block-production and block records across a wide network of nodes, decentralization prevents single points of failure that can compromise the system.

## Minimum Attack Vector (MAV)

MAV examines how many stake pools would need to be compromised for an attacker to gain a majority of the block production of the network (51% attack). This metric is also known as Nakamoto Coefficient.

## Geographic Node Distribution

Geographic node distribution refers to the global placement of nodes. High distribution improves resiliancy because some nodes are likely to remain operating at any time.
