# Decentralization Metrics

Blockchains rely on decentralization to maintain long-term resilience and security. By distributing block-production and block records across a wide network of nodes, decentralization prevents single points of failure that can compromise the system.

## Decentralization Indexes

Compare Cardano's decentralization with other blockchains.

- [Edinburgh Decentralization Index](http://blockchainlab.inf.ed.ac.uk/edi-dashboard/): University of Edinburgh initiative to objectively measure the decentralization of major cryptocurrencies across various layers.

## Minimum Attack Vector (MAV)

MAV measures how many stake pools would need to be compromised for an attacker to gain a majority of the network's block production (51% attack). This metric is also known as Nakamoto Coefficient.

## Geographic Node Distribution

Geographic node distribution refers to the global spread of blockchain nodes, enhancing network resilience by reducing single points of failure.

## Full Node Size

The size of a Cardano full node indicates the amount of storage needed to maintain the complete blockchain record.
