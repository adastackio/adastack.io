# Decentralization Metrics

Blockchains need decentralization for resilience and security. By distributing block-production and block records across a wide network of nodes, decentralization prevents single points of failure that can compromise the system.

## Decentralization Index

Compare Cardano's decentralization with other blockchains.

- [Edinburgh Decentralization Index](http://blockchainlab.inf.ed.ac.uk/edi-dashboard/)<OS url="https://github.com/Blockchain-Technology-Lab" />: University of Edinburgh initiative to measure the decentralization of major cryptocurrencies.

## Minimum Attack Vector (MAV)

MAV measures how many stake pools would need to be compromised for an attacker to gain a majority of the network's block production (51% attack). This metric is also known as Nakamoto Coefficient.

- [Cexplorer Groups](https://cexplorer.io/groups)<OS url="https://github.com/cexplorer" />: MAV by stake pool

## Geographic Node Distribution

Geographic node distribution refers to the global spread of blockchain nodes, enhancing network resilience by reducing single points of failure.

- [Cexplorer.io Relays](https://cexplorer.io/relays)<OS url="https://github.com/cexplorer" />: Country and ISP distribution
- [Pooltool Network Health](https://pooltool.io/networkhealth)<OS url="https://github.com/PoolTool-io" />: Data center distribution
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/m24jHTNX1DM): Geographic and ISP distribution

- [Cardano.org Explorer](https://beta.explorer.cardano.org/en/micar)<OS url="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-explorer" />: Nodes per country

## Full Node Size

The size of a Cardano full node indicates the amount of storage needed to maintain the complete blockchain record.

## Staking Metrics

Staking Metrics provide data on delegations, rewards, and the total value staked in Cardano's network.

- [Balance Analytics](https://www.balanceanalytics.io/chartboards/utxo_allocation): Staking status of all ADA UTXOs on Cardano.
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/ngjdnF7UcC0): Delegation stats by day
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/jPLgGGDCuww): Delegation stats by epoch
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/tfLPyoVjJG0): Stake Pool stats by epoch

## Block Production Metrics

Block Production Metrics track statistics on blocks production and missed blocks over time.

- [Cexplorer Producers](https://cexplorer.io/producers): Total pools and how many of them produce blocks.
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/nwBRCIaRdRQ): Blocks produced per epoch and missed blocks.

## Block Propagation Metrics
