# Decentralization Metrics

Decentralization is pivotal in blockchain networks. This is achieved by distributing the network's computation across thousands of independent nodes. These metrics help quantify Cardano's decentralization.

## Decentralization Index

Compare Cardano's decentralization metrics compared to other blockchains.

<DefaultDataTable projects={builders} filterBy="decentralization_index" />

## Geographic Node Distribution

The worldwide distribution of nodes across different regions, indicating network resilience.

<DefaultDataTable projects={builders} filterBy="node_distribution_metrics" />

## ISP Diversity

Internet service provider distribution among Cardano nodes, measuring network infrastructure diversity.

<DefaultDataTable projects={builders} filterBy="isp_diversity_metrics" />

## Node Versions

Node versions being run on the Cardano network.

<DefaultDataTable projects={builders} filterBy="node_version_metrics" />

## Full Node Size

The amount of storage needed to have a full copy of a blockchain.

<DefaultDataTable projects={builders} filterBy="node_storage_metrics" />

## Minimum Attack Vector (MAV)

MAV measures how many stake pools would need to be compromised for an attacker to gain a majority of the network's block production (51% attack).

## Staking Metrics

Staking data including delegations, rewards, and total value staked inÂ the Cardano network.

## Block Production Metrics

Track data on blocks production and missed blocks.

## Block Propagation Metrics

Block transmission speeds and efficiency across the global network of nodes.
