# Decentralization Metrics

Decentralization is pivotal in blockchain networks. This is achieved by distributing the network's computation across thousands of independent nodes. These metrics help quantify Cardano's decentralization.

## Decentralization Index

Cardano's decentralization metrics compared to other blockchains.

- [Edinburgh Decentralization Index](http://blockchainlab.inf.ed.ac.uk/edi-dashboard/)<OS url="https://blockchainlab.inf.ed.ac.uk/edi-dashboard/" />: University of Edinburgh initiative to measure the decentralization of major cryptocurrencies.

## Geographic Node Distribution

The worldwide distribution of nodes across different regions, indicating network resilience.

- [Cexplorer.io Relays](https://cexplorer.io/relays)<OS url="https://github.com/cexplorer" />: Country and ISP distribution.
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/m24jHTNX1DM): Geographic and ISP distribution.
- [MonadPool](https://monadpool.com/cardano.html): Relay Map.
- [Relay Geolocation](https://relaygeolocatio.netlify.app/): Geolocation Map for Cardano Relays.
- [Cardano.org Explorer](https://beta.explorer.cardano.org/en/micar)<OS url="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-explorer" />: Nodes per country.

## ISP Diversity

Internet service provider distribution among Cardano nodes, measuring network infrastructure diversity.

- [Cexplorer.io Relays](https://cexplorer.io/relays)<OS url="https://github.com/cexplorer" />: ISP distribution breakdown.
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/m24jHTNX1DM): Relays per provider.
- [Pooltool Network Health](https://pooltool.io/networkhealth)<OS url="https://github.com/PoolTool-io" />: Data center distribution.

## Node Versions

Node versions being run on the Cardano network.

- [Cexplorer Versions](https://cexplorer.io/versions)<OS url="https://github.com/cexplorer" />: Node version charts.
- [Pooltool](https://pooltool.io/networkhealth)<OS url="https://github.com/PoolTool-io" />: Node version charts.
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/ptQ2TyzLyog): Node version chart.

## Full Node Size

The amount of storage needed to have a full copy of a blockchain.

- [Cexplorer Storage](https://cexplorer.io/storage)<OS url="https://github.com/cexplorer" />: Total storage in MB.
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/rkbL4boJKeY): Ledger size in bytes.

## Minimum Attack Vector (MAV)

MAV measures how many stake pools would need to be compromised for an attacker to gain a majority of the network's block production (51% attack).

- [Cexplorer Groups](https://cexplorer.io/groups)<OS url="https://github.com/cexplorer" />: MAV by stake pool.
- [Balance Analytics Cardano Donut Chart](https://www.balanceanalytics.io/chartboards/donut_shop)<OS url="https://github.com/Balance-Analytics" />: MAV donut graphs.
- [Balance Analytics Cardano Decentralization Metrics](https://www.balanceanalytics.io/chartboards/decentralization)<OS url="https://github.com/Balance-Analytics" />: MAV graphs.

## Staking Metrics

Staking data including delegations, rewards, and total value staked inÂ the Cardano network.

- [Balance Analytics](https://www.balanceanalytics.io/chartboards/utxo_allocation)<OS url="https://github.com/Balance-Analytics" />: Staking status of all ADA UTXOs on Cardano.
- [CardanoScan](https://cardanoscan.io/analytics/epochRewardDistribution)<OS url="https://github.com/StricaHQ" />: Reward distribution chart per epoch.
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/ngjdnF7UcC0): Staking stats by day.
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/jPLgGGDCuww): Staking stats by epoch.

- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/lFEdCKh30Kk): Stake Pool stats by epoch (2).

## Block Production

Track data on blocks production and missed blocks.

- [Cexplorer Producers](https://cexplorer.io/producers)<OS url="https://github.com/cexplorer" />: Ratio of total pools to block producers.
- [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/nwBRCIaRdRQ): Blocks per epoch and missed blocks.

## Block Propagation Speed

Block transmission speeds and efficiency across the global network of nodes.

- [Cardano.org Explorer](https://beta.explorer.cardano.org/en/network-monitoring)<OS url="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-explorer" />: Block propagation times per day and epoch.
- [Pooltool.io](https://pooltool.io/networkhealth)<OS url="https://github.com/PoolTool-io" />: Block propagation time and delays.
