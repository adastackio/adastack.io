# Wallets

Wallets let you store ADA and use Cardano DApps. Follow our [setup guide](../intro_to_cardano/set_up_a_wallet), review [security tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/wiki/wallets/seedphrase/), and learn about [common scams](https://cardano.org/common-scams/). It's recommended to use open-source wallets so their integrity can be verified.

## Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets are phone apps for quick, on-the-go transactions. Pair with hardware wallet for extra security.
