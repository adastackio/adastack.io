# Wallets

Wallets let you store ADA and use Cardano dApps. Follow our [setup guide](../intro_to_cardano/set_up_a_wallet), review [security tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/wiki/wallets/seedphrase/), and learn about [common scams](https://cardano.org/common-scams/). It's recommended to use open-source wallets so their integrity can be verified.

## Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets are phone apps for quick, on-the-go transactions. They are convenient but not the most secure option unless paired with a hardware wallet.

## Browser Wallets

Browser wallets are browser extensions that enable dApp interactions. They can be installed in your web browser of choice. Pair with hardware wallet for extra security.

## Desktop Wallets

Desktop wallets are full-featured applications for power users. Uniquely, Daedalus runs as a full node (meaning it stores a copy of the entire blockchain) for enhanced security.

## Hardware Wallets

Physical devices that store cryptocurrency offline. They are the most secure wallet, as PIN verification is needed to make transactions. They can connect to browser and mobile wallets and interact with dApps.

No-install web wallets for convenient access. Verify URLs carefully and use trusted sites only. Pair with hardware wallet for extra security.

## Identity Wallets

Identity wallets securely store and manage personal credentials like IDs and documents. This gives users control over how their credentials are shared and accessed.

## Multisig Wallets

Multisig wallets require signatures from multiple parties to approve transactions. They are ideal for managing shared funds like DAO treasuries.

## Dev Wallets

Tools for testing and developing Cardano applications. These may also be prototypes or reference implementations. Not for everyday use.
