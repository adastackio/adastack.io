# On-Chain and Off-Chain
A Cardano smart contract is a set of rules that you can use to do things with your money or other things on the internet. A smart contract has two parts: a screen and a code. The screen is what you see and touch, and the code is what tells the smart contract what to do. But the code is not run by one computer, but by many computers that work together. There are two kinds of code: on chain and off chain.
* On chain code is the code that runs on the Cardano network, which is like a big group of computers that agree with each other. The on chain code is used to check if you can do what you want to do with the smart contract. For example, if you want to buy something with the smart contract, the on chain code will make sure you have enough money and the seller has what you want. The on chain code is written in a special language called Plutus, and it is saved on the internet for everyone to see.
* Off chain code is the code that runs on your own device, like your phone or laptop. The off chain code is used to help you use the smart contract. For example, if you want to buy something with the smart contract, the off chain code will help you fill in the details of what you want to buy, how much you want to pay, and where you want to send it. The off chain code is also written in Plutus, but it is not saved on the internet for everyone to see.
