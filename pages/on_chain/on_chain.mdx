# On-Chain and Off-Chain
A Cardano smart contract is a set of rules that you can use to do things with your money or other things on the internet. A smart contract has two parts: a screen and a code. The screen is what you see and touch, and the code is what tells the smart contract what to do. But the code is not run by one computer, but by many computers that work together. There are two kinds of code: on chain and off chain.
* On chain code is the code that runs on the Cardano network, which is like a big group of computers that agree with each other. The on chain code is used to check if you can do what you want to do with the smart contract. For example, if you want to buy something with the smart contract, the on chain code will make sure you have enough money and the seller has what you want. The on chain code is written in a special language called Plutus, and it is saved on the internet for everyone to see.
* Off chain code is the code that runs on your own device, like your phone or laptop. The off chain code is used to help you use the smart contract. For example, if you want to buy something with the smart contract, the off chain code will help you fill in the details of what you want to buy, how much you want to pay, and where you want to send it. The off chain code is also written in Plutus, but it is not saved on the internet for everyone to see.

# What can you do On-Chain?
1.Send and Receive ADA:In Cardano, transactions involving ADA, the native cryptocurrency, occur directly on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. These on-chain transactions are securely stored on the Cardano blockchain, providing a transparent record of all activities.

2.Stake your ADA:Utilizing Cardano's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, ADA holders can stake their tokens to earn rewards and contribute to network security. By staking ADA on-chain, participants play a pivotal role in fostering a sustainable and decentralized ecosystem while earning passive income in the form of ADA rewards.

3.Use dApps:Cardano supports a diverse range of decentralized applications (dApps), including DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and prediction markets, all of which operate securely and transparently on-chain. By engaging with dApps on Cardano, users benefit from the security and immutability inherent in on-chain operations.

4.Trade NFTs:Trading NFTs on Cardano occurs on-chain, ensuring that all transactions are verifiable and transparent. With on-chain trading, the authenticity and provenance of NFTs can be easily validated, fostering trust within the marketplace.

5.Vote on Catalyst:Catalyst, Cardano's decentralized governance fund, enables ADA holders to participate in on-chain voting to determine the allocation of funds for projects benefiting the Cardano ecosystem. Through on-chain voting in their wallets, users actively shape the future development of Cardano.

6.Participate in Governance:Cardano's self-governing blockchain empowers ADA holders to vote on protocol changes, furthering the platform's efficiency and security. All governance activities, including voting on proposals, occur on-chain, ensuring transparency and inclusivity in decision-making processes.
