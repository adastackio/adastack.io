# Cardano Vocab to Know

### ADA
ADA is the primary currency of the Cardano network. It is used for various purposes such as making transactions, interacting with decentralized applications (Dapps), staking, and voting. 

It is named after Ada Lovelace, the 19th-century mathematician who is recognized as the first computer programmer.

### Lovelace 
ADA can be divided into smaller units called Lovelace, similar to how a dollar is divided into cents. One Lovelace is the smallest possible unit of ADA. 

One ADA is equivalent to 1,000,000 Lovelace. Inversely, one Lovelace is equal to 0.000001 ADA.

### Smart Contracts 
Smart contracts are digital agreements written into code. They execute automatically once the terms of the agreement are met. 

This revolutionary idea allows for people and businesses to conduct financial agreements without the need for a middleman. It also allows for the creation of decentralized applications (Dapps) that can disrupt traditional industries and empower users.
