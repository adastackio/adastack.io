# Cardano Vocab to Know

### ADA
ADA is the primary currency of the Cardano network. It is used for various purposes such as making transactions, interacting with decentralized applications (Dapps), staking, and voting. 

It is named after Ada Lovelace, the 19th-century mathematician who is recognized as the first computer programmer.

### Lovelace 
ADA can be divided into smaller units called Lovelace, similar to how a dollar is divided into cents. One Lovelace is the smallest possible unit of ADA. 

One ADA is equivalent to 1,000,000 Lovelace. Inversely, one Lovelace is equal to 0.000001 ADA.

### Smart Contracts 
Smart contracts are digital agreements written into code. They execute automatically once the terms of the agreement are met. 

This revolutionary idea allows for people and businesses to conduct financial agreements without the need for a middleman. It also allows for the creation of decentralized applications (Dapps) that can disrupt traditional industries and empower users. 

### Blockchain 
Blockchain is a secure, digital ledger that records transactions in tamper-proof blocks, creating an unalterable and transparent history.

### Block 
A block in a blockchain is like a timestamped witness statement, forever locked in place and connected to others, ensuring everyone agrees on what happened and when.

### Wallet  
A wallet in blockchain is a software or device that allows users to store, manage, and transact with cryptocurrencies using public and private keys.

### Ouroboros
Cardano's Ouroboros protocol leverages a novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) approach inspired by the ouroboros symbol, where epochs and slots govern block creation and validation, ensuring secure and sustainable network growth with unparalleled energy efficiency.

### Proof of stake  
Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism in blockchain networks where validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral, thus incentivizing network security and participation.

### Staking
Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency as collateral to participate in blockchain networks and earn rewards for validating transactions or securing the network.

### Stake Pool
A stake pool is a collective of cryptocurrency holders who combine their resources to increase their chances of being chosen as validators in a Proof of Stake blockchain network and share the rewards earned from block creation and transaction validation.

### Stake Pool Operator (SPO)
A stake pool operator is an individual or entity responsible for managing a stake pool in a Proof of Stake blockchain network, facilitating the participation of stakeholders and ensuring the proper operation of the pool to maximize rewards for participants.

### Epoch
An epoch in blockchain refers to a predefined period during which network parameters such as block creation and validation rules remain constant, typically used in Proof of Stake systems to organize and manage voting, rewards distribution, and other network functions.

### NFT  
NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets stored on a blockchain that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a specific item, such as digital art, collectibles, or virtual real estate.

### Native Assets 
A native asset refers to a cryptocurrency or token that is native to a specific blockchain platform, typically used as a means of value transfer, payment, or participation within the ecosystem of that blockchain.

### Dapp 
A DApp, or decentralized application, is a software application that operates on a decentralized network such as a blockchain, enabling peer-to-peer interactions without relying on a central authority, offering transparency, security, and censorship resistance.

### DEX  
A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a type of cryptocurrency exchange that operates without a central authority, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other on a peer-to-peer basis, enhancing privacy, security, and control over funds.

### Stablecoin  
A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by pegging it to a fiat currency, a commodity, or algorithmic mechanisms, offering a reliable medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account within the volatile cryptocurrency market.

### Governance  
Cardano's on-chain governance empowers ADA holders to vote on proposals and steer the network's future, shaping it into a truly community-driven and self-evolving blockchain.

### Project Catalyst  
Project Catalyst, the world's largest on-chain funding experiment, empowers the Cardano community to propose, evaluate, and vote on impactful projects using their ADA, fostering innovation and shaping the blockchain's future through collective intelligence.

### Plutus  
As the native smart contract language of Cardano, Plutus unlocks secure and versatile dApp development with its functional programming paradigm, empowering businesses and developers to build innovative solutions on a scalable and sustainable blockchain.

### Node
A computer running blockchain software, verifying transactions and maintaining the network.

### UTXO and eUTXO  
Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) and Extended UTXO are models for tracking cryptocurrency ownership on a blockchain.

### Self Sovereign Identity (SSI)  
A digital identity you control, independent of any centralized authority.

### Web 3  
A vision of a decentralized internet built on blockchains, empowering users and removing intermediaries.

### On-Chain  
Data or actions directly stored and executed on the blockchain, transparent and verifiable.
