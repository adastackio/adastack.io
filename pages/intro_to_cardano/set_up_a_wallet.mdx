# Set up a Wallet

A digital wallet acts as your personal vault to store and send ADA. Creating your wallet upfront ensures it's ready to receive ADA once its been purchased from an exchange.

### Types of Wallets

Different types of wallets serve different needs. Check out these guides to understand important differences between hot and cold wallets, custodial vs non-custodial, and more.

### Wallet Security Notes

- When you create a wallet, you'll will receive a list of words known as a seed phrase. This is the master key to your funds. Write it down, keep it safe, don't share it, and don't store it online! Read more [seed phrase tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/wiki/wallets/seedphrase/).
- Make sure you are downloading the wallet from the official website, as scammers often make fake wallet websites to trick users. You can double-check the URL against those on [CardanoCube](https://www.cardanocube.com/categories/wallets) and [BuiltOnCardano](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/wallets).
- The most secure way to hold ADA is using a [hardware wallet](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/hardware-wallet), a physical device that requires PIN confirmation to authorize transactions. This is the recommended method for any sizeable ADA holdings.

## Set up your Wallet

Setting up a Cardano wallet is simple. First, download your preferred wallet directly from their official website. Second, start the software and carefully follow the "create a new wallet" instructions.

The most important step during the process is to write down the recovery phrase (think "master key") and store it securely offline.
