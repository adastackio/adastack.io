# Start Using Cardano

Once you've created and funded a Cardano wallet there are a lot of options available. You can transact it, stake it to earn rewards, or use a Cardano dApp (decentralized application).

### Ways to use the Cardano Network

Once you have some ADA in your wallet there are many options available:

- [Stake your ADA](https://www.adastack.io/staking/start_staking)
- Send and receive assets
- Trade for other tokens on a decentralized exchange (DEX)
- Use decentralized application (dApp)
- Buy an NFT on an NFT marketplace
- Participate in Catalyst
- Delegate to a DRep
