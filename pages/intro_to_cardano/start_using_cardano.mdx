# Start Using Cardano

Once you've created and funded a Cardano wallet there are many options to start using the network. Here are some ideas to get started.

### Stake Your ADA

Staking ADA allows you to earn around 3% yearly rewards while helping secure the Cardano network. Staking ADA is safe, as your coins remain in your wallet and under your control.

- [How to Stake your ADA](../staking/start_staking)
- [Reward Trackers](../staking/stake_reward_trackers): Estimate and track staking rewards

- Send and receive assets
- Trade for other tokens on a decentralized exchange (DEX)
- Buy a digital asset on an NFT marketplace
- Use decentralized application (dApp)
- Participate in Catalyst
- Delegate to a DRep
