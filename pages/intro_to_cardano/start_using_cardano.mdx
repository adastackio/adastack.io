# Start Using Cardano

Getting started on Cardano is easy. First, you'll set up a Cardano wallet. Then, buy ADA on a cryptocurrency exchange and send it to your wallet. At this point you can transact it, stake it to earn rewards, or use a Cardano dApp (decentralized application).

Here is a step-by-step guide:

<Steps>
### Make a Wallet
A digital wallet acts as your personal vault for storing and sending ADA. Creating your wallet first ensures it's ready to receive ADA after your exchange purchase.

#### Choose a Wallet

The first step is to choose a wallet.

**Browser Wallets:**

- [Lace](https://www.lace.io/)<OS url="https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace" /> and [Nami](https://www.namiwallet.io/)<OS url="https://github.com/input-output-hk/nami" /> are simplified desktop wallets that are perfect for first-time users.
- [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/)<OS url="https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi" />, [Typhon](https://typhonwallet.io/), and [Eternl](https://eternl.io/) are more advanced browser wallets that offer a number of interesting features.

**Mobile Wallets:**

- [Vespr](https://vespr.xyz/), [Begin](https://begin.is/), and [Tokeo](https://tokeopay.io/) are some go-to options that are largely adopted by the community.

**Hardware Wallets:**

The most secure way to hold ADA is a [hardware wallet](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/hardware-wallet), a physical device that require confirmations to authorize transactions.

- Well-known options include [Trezor](https://trezor.io/)<OS url="https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware" /> and [Keystone](https://keyst.one/)<OS url="https://github.com/KeystoneHQ/keystone3-firmware" />.

**More Options:**

#### Set up the Wallet

Setting up a Cardano wallet involves downloading a wallet application, creating a new wallet, and securely storing the generated recovery phrase for future access.

**Important Things to Know**

- When creating a wallet you will receive a list of words known as a seed phrase. This is the master key to your funds. Write it down, keep it safe, don't share it, and don't store it anywhere online! Here are more [seed phrase tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/wiki/wallets/seedphrase/).
- Make sure you are downloading the wallet from the official website because sometimes scammers make fake websites to trick users. You can double-check the URL on [CardanoCube](https://www.cardanocube.com/categories/wallets) and [BuiltOnCardano](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/wallets).

### Buy ADA

ADA is available to buy on many Centralized Exchanges (CEXs).

#### Choose an Exchange and make an Account

Here are some [considerations when choosing an exchange](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/au/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-cardano-ada/) and here is a [list of all the centralized exchanges that sell ADA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano#markets). You can choose one with a good reputation that's available in your country.

If you want to make it easy you can choose one of the largest, most trusted exchanges from the options below:  
[Cardano on Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/learn/buy-cardano-ada)  
[Cardano on Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/how-to-buy/cardano)  
[Cardano on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/how-to-buy/cardano)

When you create an account it is recommended to use a strong password and 2FA for added security.

#### Fund the Exchange

To fund your exchange account you'll first link it to your bank account or another funding method. Follow the instructions on your exchange to do this. Once it is linked you can fund send money into the exchange to prepare to trade.

#### Make a Purchase Order

Once you have money on the exchange you can set an order. You can buy at the current price by using a "market order". If you want to try and get a lower price you can set a specific low price using a "limit order", in which case the order will execute if ADA hits that price. There are some other [order types](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/crypto-order-types-101-from-market-to-limit/) too but they are not really needed to get started.

#### Send the ADA to your Wallet

Once you have purchased your ADA on an exchange you can send it to your wallet. [This guide explains](https://help.sundaeswap.finance/en/articles/5852067-how-to-transfer-your-ada-to-a-non-custodial-wallet) how to send ADA from an exchange to a wallet.
