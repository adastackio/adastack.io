# Why Cardano?

As a scientifically-developed blockchain, Cardano offers a secure platform to bank and use decentralized services.

## Fundamentals & Vision

### Thorough Research

Beginning in 2015, [IOG](https://iohk.io/) partnered with over [30 top institutions](https://iohk.io/en/research/), including Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Edinburgh. These collaborations resulted in [200+ research papers](https://iohk.io/en/research/) that created the basis for Cardano's security, decentralization, and reliability.

IOG translated this academic research into Cardano's software using formal methods, including mathematical specifications, property-based testing, and proofs. This careful approach helps ensure that every part of the system works exactly as intended.

### Capped Supply and Predictable Monetary Policy

Cardano has a fixed maximum supply of 45 billion ADA, with over 35 billion already in circulation. Like Bitcoin, this hard cap creates digital scarcity and helps preserve value over time.

The remaining 10 billion ADA are strategically released as rewards to block producers (known as stake pools) using a [precise formula](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/monetary-policy/). As more blocks are created, the rewards gradually decrease, creating natural scarcity while maintaining network security.

### Fair Distribution

ADA stands out as one of the most equitably distributed cryptocurrencies. At launch, only [11.5%](https://cardano.org/genesis/) was allocated to founding entities for development and marketing, while the remaining 88.5% is designated for public circulation and future block rewards.

The Cardano network has an engaged community with over [85 million](https://cexplorer.io/article/how-many-ada-holders-are-there-in-the-world) ADA holders worldwide. This wide distribution is beneficial for robust decentralization, engaged governance, and a vibrant ecosystem.

### Real World Focus

Nearly 2 billion people—38% of adults globally—lack access to basic financial services. Cardano addresses this by offering a borderless financial system that enables anyone to participate in the digital economy.

Cardano powers projects tackling real-world challenges like [housing finance](https://empowa.io/), [decentralized communication](https://worldmobile.io/), and [sustainable supply chains](https://palmyra.app/). Its DeFi tools allow users to access essential services like lending, borrowing, and trading.

### Record of Reliability

Since its launch in 2017, Cardano has achieved over 2,300 consecutive days of 100% uptime—outperforming even tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.

This exceptional resilience is the result of thoughtful design decisions. These qualities make Cardano a trusted platform for global financial applications and an ideal place to build dependable systems.

### Environmentally Sound

Cardano leads the way in sustainable blockchain technology with its energy-efficient proof-of-stake design. Unlike proof-of-work systems, Cardano’s consensus mechanism drastically reduces energy consumption while maintaining the same [robust security guarantees as Bitcoin](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-a-provably-secure-proof-of-stake-blockchain-protocol/).

This eco-friendly approach makes Cardano a standout choice for those seeking a blockchain that prioritizes environmental sustainability. By combining low energy use with high security and scalability, Cardano proves that blockchain technology can evolve responsibly with our world.

### Be your own Bank

With Cardano, users can transact and store value without intermediaries. The network enshrines strong property rights and equal treatment directly into its constitution and code. This decentralized peer-to-peer nature promotes financial freedom.

Besides digital assets, Cardano also offers powerful identity tools, which can serve as an alternative to traditional IDs. These decentralized Identities (DIDs) provide a way for undocumented people to establish reputation and credentials, enabling new opportunities with loans, investments, real estate, employment, and more.

## Technical Architecture

### Simple Staking

Cardano's Proof-of-Stake design is one of the best in crypto. The concept of staking is that a user will point, or delegate, their ADA toward a block-producing stake pool they trust. The more ADA a stake pool has delegated to it, the more likely it will produce additional blocks. When a stake pool produces a new block they earn a "block reward" for themselves and the people that stake to them. Staking aligns incentives and helps maintain Cardano's dynamic decentralization.

Staking provides security to the Cardano system because it makes it extremely expensive to attack Cardano. To do so, attackers would have to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of ADA and execute a coordinated [51% attack](https://cexplorer.io/article/how-expensive-is-attacking-cardano-and-bitcoin). As As long as a majority of the network's staked value is delegated to honest stake pools then a 51% attack is not possible.

Users that stake ADA receive rewards every 5 days. Staking is risk-free: Staked ADA never leaves your wallet and can be spent anytime. [Over 60% of ADA currently in circulation is staked](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/k5r9B?s=huXqeQmi9qA). Broad staking participation boosts the health, security, and decentralization of the network. Passive income from staking also makes ADA an attractive asset to hold long-term.

[Learn more about staking here](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation/) and [see how much ADA you could earn from staking](https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator).

### Truly Decentralized Consensus

Cardano is the most decentralized of the major blockchains. Cardano's ledger is maintained and updated by 3000+ community-operated nodes known as stake pools. Stake pools are located all over the world, which allows Cardano to continue operating in the face of unexpected events as long as some stake pools keep producing blocks. Incentives and cryptography make it nearly impossible to disrupt or tamper with the Cardano ledger.

Decentralization also means that decision-making is distributed. Network upgrades must be approved by the majority of stake pools. This ensures that decisions are made collectively and no single entity has direct control over the network.

[See statistics about Cardano's decentralization compared to other top blockchains.](http://blockchainlab.inf.ed.ac.uk/edi-dashboard/)

### Programmable Smart Contracts

The biggest factor to Cardano's versatility are smart contracts. These are digital agreements that execute automatically once the conditions within them are met.

Smart contracts are a great way to build blockchain-enabled contracts. Beyond that, they provide powerful building blocks to create complex applications on Cardano. These applications (called dApps or decentralized apps) have the benefit that they treat all users equally. Their code cannot be changed once created and they can be trusted to always execute as written.

Here are a few examples of what you can create with smart contracts:

- **Contracts** — Self-executing agreements between multiple parties that don't require intermediaries such as banks or lawyers.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** — Financial applications including lending and borrowing platforms, prediction markets, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)** — Collaborative organization that allows users to make proposals, vote, manage a shared treasury, and take collective action toward a shared purpose.
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)** — Identity solutions where users control their own data and build reputation on the blockchain.
- **Supply Chain Systems** — Blockchain supply chain systems allow businesses and consumers to see immutable records of exactly where their goods come from.

Smart contracts are a versatile tool that can create the items highlighted above, and many more. In fact, many of their most important uses probably haven't been invented yet.

### Great Place to Build

Much like the internet, blockchains are open systems that anyone can build projects on without permission. This allows for a positive innovation loop as builders try different ideas and develop new solutions.

Cardano has a rapidly growing ecosystem of dApps (decentralized applications). Dapp builders benefit from building on a stable platform with predictable transaction fees and a highly engaged community. Hundreds of projects have already launched and over 1000 more are in development. [Explore some of the dApps available here](https://www.cardanocube.com/cardano-ecosystem-interactive-map).

There is an increasing number of languages that can create smart contracts. Smart contracts can now be written in [Haskell](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus), [Python](https://opshin.dev/), [TypeScript](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plu-ts), [Go](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/plutigo), as well as dedicated languages like [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/). Smart contracts can also be created in a visual drag-and-drop editor using [Marlowe](https://marlowe.iohk.io/). This diversity of options make Cardano increasingly accessible for developers from different backgrounds.

Furthermore, additional development improvements are taking place. Coding environments like [Demeter Run](https://demeter.run/), [Kuber IDE](https://kuberide.com/), and [Jambhala Dev Suite](https://github.com/iburzynski/jambhala) make it easy to get set up and start coding. Projects like [Lucid](https://lucid.spacebudz.io/) and [Mesh](https://meshjs.dev/) offer powerful building blocks to build dApps. [Plutus](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus), the original smart contract language, is also undergoing continuous advancement and is adding new features.

## Ecosystem & Community

### Democratic Governance

The first element of long-term sustainability is governance, which puts the control of the Cardano network in the hands of users. This improves Cardano's long-term trajectory because it means the Cardano network can continuously adapt to the needs and desires of users. Governance empowers the community to be engaged because they have a real stake in decision making process.

Democratic governance is a key element in the long-term strategy of Cardano. Governance puts decisions about Cardano's future in the hands of ADA holders. Users can create and vote on proposals that will determine the evolution of Cardano. The goal is that the network can adapt to needs of its users and a changing world as it progresses into the future.

Governance is [in the process of being implemented](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/). The plan includes a system of checks and balances to protect from any individual or group from gaining too much power. Read more about the plan for [Cardano governance here](https://www.1694.io/).

### Engaged and Longstanding Community

Cardano was launched in 2017. This makes it one of the more long-standing crypto networks. Since launch, Cardano has remained in the top 10 by market cap and attracted a global user base in the tens of millions. It is one of the most widely held and traded crypto assets and has [thousands of projects building on it](https://www.essentialcardano.io/development-update). It even ranked higher than Bitcoin and all other blockchains for [brand intimacy](https://mblm.com/lab/brandintimacy-study/industries/crypto/).

This wide availability and recognition gives Cardano and diverse base of users that contribute to its vibrant ecosystem and active governance.

Cardano has a committed and highly active community. Some of the main discussion centers are X, Reddit, Telegram, and YouTube, where community members regularly engage in discussions and share updates. The conversation consists of a vibrant mix of participants, including stake pool operators, programmers, businesses, entrepreneurs, activists, investors, and artists, all with the common goal of building a decentralized economy and ecosystem on Cardano.

### Diverse Ecosystem

Over the last few years Cardano has seen a diverse explosion of projects launching, including DeFi, identity, NFTs, social media, telecom, AI, gaming, computing and much more. This variety constitutes the basis for a healthy and sustainable digital economy, where users can find everything they need in one place.

Some of the most promising Cardano projects are utilizing the Cardano platform to revolutionize existing industries. Some of these projects include [World Mobile](https://worldmobile.io/) to revolutionize telecom, [Book.io](https://book.io/) to disrupt publishing, and [Axo Finance](https://www.axo.trade/) to create better trading platforms.

### Open-Source Ethos

The code behind Cardano is [open source](https://github.com/IntersectMBO). This builds trust because anyone can see exactly how the platform is built. It also allows any potential issues to be found and resolved quickly.

The custodian of the source code is the [Intersect Organization](https://www.intersectmbo.org/), which coordinates community members to maintain Cardano's core technology and creates a roadmap for the future. Intersect serves as a central hub for community discussion, governance, and development within the Cardano community.

## Future & Roadmap

### Roadmap

Cardano has a well-defined roadmap with 5 major stages. The stages can be simplified as:

1. [Cardano's Launch](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/byron/)
2. [Improved Decentralization](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/shelley/)
3. [Introduction of Smart Contracts](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/)
4. [Scaling the Blockchain](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/basho/)
5. [Introduction of Governance](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/)

Stages 1 through 3 are mostly complete, though improvements continue. Now the focus is on stage 4 and 5. Stage 4, known as Basho, aims to improve scalability so Cardano can process more transactions and serve more users. Stage 5, known as Voltaire, enables democratic governance so that users can vote to help decide Cardano's future. Read the [full roadmap here](https://roadmap.cardano.org/).

### Treasury

The second element of sustainability is the Cardano Treasury. This is a substantial fund of ADA that is set aside for the growth of Cardano. Once governance is implemented it will be managed by the Cardano community who can vote on how to deploy treasury funds. The treasury is self-sustaining because it receives a small percentage of ADA from the fees of each transaction, and from block rewards. As the Cardano grows the treasury grows as well. See the [current state of the treasury here](https://cexplorer.io/pot).

### Scaling and Partner Chains

Scalability refers to the ability of the network to handle large volumes of transactions quickly and cheaply. The Cardano network has been designed from the start with scalability in mind. The current transaction throughput is sufficient for now, but once Cardano gains further adoption it will need to employ more scaling solutions.

There are initiatives underway to improve Cardano's scalability while preserving decentralization. These include [Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/), [input endorsers](https://cexplorer.io/article/understanding-input-endorsers), sidechains, and layer 2s. Scaling will be achieved through multiple strategies, giving users the option to use whatever makes sense for them. [See details about some scaling strategies here](https://cardano-scaling.org/).

Interoperability is the property of being able to transfer value to and from other blockchains outside Cardano ecosystem. It also relates to interfacing with the traditional financial system. This is important because it facilitates the flow of money between platforms and improves the blockchain experience for users.

One major initiative that is aiming to solve this is the "side chain" or "partner chain" framework that being added to Cardano. This framework allows other custom blockchains to be created that can interact seamlessly with Cardano. As an example, [Midnight](https://midnight.network/) is a Cardano partner chain that is built to protect sensitive data for business use cases. Partner chains have custom features that make them more suitable for certain uses. With partner chains, assets can be sent freely between these chains and the Cardano blockchain.

### Bright Future Ahead

Cardano's identity solutions also give individuals greater ownership of their personal data than the current system. As things stand, it is normal for companies to hold their user's personal information even though they often sell it, use it in bad ways, or lose it in data breaches. Identity solutions provide a new model in which you are the owner of your identity information and can share more their information more selectively, or even prove eligibility (for example, that they are older than 18) without sharing any personal information whatsoever using powerful zero-knowledge proof technology.

See [Atala Prism](https://atalaprism.io/) and the [Identity Wallet](https://identity.cardanofoundation.org) for an intro to Cardano identify solutions.

Bitcoin represents the first-generation of blockchain, which introduced secure and decentralized cryptocurrency networks to the world.

Ethereum is the first of the second-generation blockchains, which added programmability and smart contract capabilities. This allowed users to interact with custom applications on the blockchain.

Cardano represents the third generation, which combines the best elements of Bitcoin (secure and decentralized sound money) and Ethereum (programmable smart contracts) while learning from the missteps of both.

Cardano's founder Charles Hoskinson designed Cardano to specifically make improvements in the areas of interoperability, scalability, and sustainability. Read a summary of each below, or read about these concepts in [Cardano's documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/why-use-cardano/).

Cardano's development continues on many fronts. There are ongoing efforts to improve Cardano's speed, resilience, privacy, governance, developer experience, and much more. The future of Cardano is bright and the community is welcoming. Feel free to get involved!
