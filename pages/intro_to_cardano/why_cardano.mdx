# Why Cardano?

### Thorough Research

Cardano is built on rigorous academic research and comprehensive testing. Since 2015, [IOG](https://iohk.io/) has partnered with over [30 institutions](https://iohk.io/en/research/), including Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Edinburgh to enhance the Cardano protocol. These collaborations resulted in [200+ research papers](https://iohk.io/en/research/).

By using methods like formal verification and peer-review, the Cardano blockchain platform has been meticulously designed for stability long-term. This scientific methodology provides the foundational bedrock of Cardano's security.

### Capped Supply and Predictable Monetary Policy

Cardano has a fixed maximum supply of 45 billion ADA, with over 35 billion already in circulation. Like Bitcoin, this hard cap creates digital scarcity and helps preserve value over time.

The remaining 10 billion ADA are algorithmically released as rewards to block producers (known as stake pools) using a [precise formula](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/monetary-policy/). As more blocks are created, rewards gradually decrease, creating natural scarcity while maintaining network security.

### Fair Distribution

ADA stands out as one of the most equitably distributed cryptocurrencies. At launch, only [11.5%](https://cardano.org/genesis/) was allocated to founding entities for development and marketing, while the remaining 88.5% is in public circulation or designated for future block rewards.

The Cardano network has an engaged community with over [85 million](https://cexplorer.io/article/how-many-ada-holders-are-there-in-the-world) ADA holders worldwide. This wide distribution is ideal for engaged governance, a vibrant ecosystem, and global decentralization.

### Real World Focus

Nearly 2 billion people—38% of adults globally—lack access to basic financial services. Cardano's technology offers a borderless alternative. Anyone can be their own bank, exchange value, and engage with secure financial services.

Beyond banking and DeFi, many Cardano projects are focused on real-world challenges like [housing finance](https://empowa.io/), [decentralized telecom](https://worldmobile.io/), and creating sustainable [supply chains](https://palmyra.app/).

### Record of Reliability

Since its launch in 2017, Cardano has achieved over 2,300 consecutive days of 100% uptime—outperforming even tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.

This consistency is the result of thoughtful design decisions and the scientifically-proven Ouroboros consensus protocol. These qualities make Cardano an ideal platform to build dependable applications for the long-term.

### Environmentally Sound

Cardano leads the way in sustainable blockchain technology with its energy-efficient proof-of-stake design. Unlike proof-of-work systems, Cardano’s consensus mechanism drastically reduces energy consumption while maintaining the same [robust security guarantees as Bitcoin](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-a-provably-secure-proof-of-stake-blockchain-protocol/).

Cardano's design demonstrates that blockchain networks can achieve robust security without huge energy expenditure. For example, Cardano is around [60,000](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/comparison-of-energy-consumption-of-cardano-and-bitcoin) times more energy-efficient than Bitcoin. Despite this minimal energy footprint, Cardano still enjoys exceptional performance and security.

### Be your own Bank

With Cardano, users can transact and store value without intermediaries. The network enshrines strong property rights and equal treatment directly into its code and constitution.

Beyond digital property, Cardano also offers powerful identity tools that further enable sovereignty. An alternative to traditional IDs, decentralized Identities (DIDs) provide a way for people to establish reputation and manage credentials securely. This is a powerful way for undocumented people to find new opportunities for employment, real estate, and more.

### Simple Staking

Cardano's innovative Proof-of-Stake mechanism enables users to earn rewards by delegating ADA to stake pools. Stake pools are special nodes that create blocks and operate the network. For their service, they are rewarded with newly created ADA as block rewards. The monetary incentives of staking reinforce network security and decentralization.

When staking, users maintain full control over the funds in their own wallets. Every 5 days, staking rewards are distributed. More than 60% of all ADA is staked, making it the most common way to earn ADA on Cardano.

### Truly Decentralized

At the heart of Cardano's architecture are the [2,500+ community-operated stake pools](https://adastat.net/pools) that maintain the blockchain. These nodes are distributed globally, ensuring resilience to regional or country-specific disruptions. By maintaining such decentralization, Cardano preserves its security and neutrality.

Decentralization isn’t just technical—Cardano’s democratic voting system puts the community in control of decisions about the network's future. By allowing any ADA holder to participate in voting, it decentralizes the decision-making behind Cardano's evolution.

### Programmable Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that take place when predefined conditions are met. These contracts form the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps). Smart contracts operate with unchangeable code, ensuring impartial and consistent execution for all users.

The possibilities enabled by smart contracts on Cardano are expansive. They are the core component of all dApps including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, marketplaces, games, DAOs, voting systems, and more. Cardano is an open system where anyone can launch their own smart contracts.

### Great Place to Build

Cardano stands out as a premier blockchain platform to build, due to its open-source, peer-reviewed foundation. This approach provides a solid foundation for developers to build upon, knowing that the underlying system has been rigorously tested and validated.

[Hundreds of dApps](https://www.cardanocube.com/cardano-ecosystem-interactive-map) are live on Cardano, driven by useful developer tools and multiple smart contract languages. The community is also very supportive of the teams building on Cardano. These factors make Cardano an attractive choice to build decentralized applications.

### Democratic Governance

Cardano's governance system puts its evolution in the hands of its community. Every ADA holder can either vote directly, or delegate their vote to a DRep, to weigh in on network updates and funding allocations.

This model helps ensure the network's evolution reflects the desires of the community, rather than a few decision-makers. Governance also leads to important conversations by giving every ADA holder a voice in network updates, funding allocations, and strategic decisions.

### Engaged Community

Since its 2017 launch, Cardano has established itself as a leading blockchain network with a global user base in the tens of millions. It consistently ranks among the top 10 by market cap and supports thousands of projects.

At its heart lies a passionate and multifaceted community. Members engage deeply across various spheres - delegating to a great [DRep](https://docs.gov.tools/cardano-govtool/using-govtool/delegating), voting in [Project Catalyst's](https://projectcatalyst.io/) innovation hub, participating in [Intersect's](https://www.intersectmbo.org/) working groups, or using the [hundreds of dApps](https://www.cardanocube.com/cardano-ecosystem-interactive-map) on Cardano. Collectively these all drive Cardano’s mission to create a thriving decentralized economy.

### Diverse Ecosystem

Cardano has a wide ecosystem of dApps including DeFi, identity, NFTs, social media, telecom, AI, gaming, DEXs, education, supply chain, and computing. It is the platform for projects [revolutionizing telecom](https://worldmobile.io/), [disrupting publishing](https://book.io/), [creating unbiased risk ratings](https://www.xerberus.io/), and more.

This variety enables a self-sustaining digital economy of interconnected services and tools, where Cardano's users can find everything they need. On the builder side, there are plenty of [development companies](https://www.adastack.io/development/dev_teams) building daily on Cardano.

### Open-Source Ethos

The code behind Cardano is open source. By making everything from the [Cardano Node](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node) to [Ouroboros Network Protocol](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network) publicly accessible, it invites developers to read and audit exactly how the protocol works.

There are a lot of open-source projects building on Cardano. When projects share their source code openly, it creates a foundation of trust through transparency. This practice enables community auditing for security, welcomes collaborative improvements, and provides reusable building blocks that accelerate development across the ecosystem.

### Clear Roadmap

For nearly a decade, Cardano has adhered to its [original roadmap](https://roadmap.cardano.org/), methodically achieving every milestone. This research-driven approach has created one of blockchain’s most secure, decentralized, and mathematically sound networks.

Cardano’s roadmap is now firmly in the hands of its community. ADA holders can vote on upgrades, treasury spending, and parameter changes. They also set the direction of Cardano's future development. Current areas of focus are scalability (increasing the amount of people can use Cardano), usability (making Cardano easier to use), and interoperability (connecting blockchains like Bitcoin to Cardano).

### Self-Sustaining Collective Treasury

The Cardano Treasury is a fund designed to sustain the blockchain long-term. With well over $1 billion in assets, this decentralized innovation engine is a substantial fund set aside for the growth of Cardano and its ecosystem.

ADA holders exercise complete control over Treasury funds via on-chain governance. The treasury is self-replenishing, as 20% of every transaction fee goes into it. The treasury is intended to fund essential development and growth initiatives. See the [state of the treasury](https://cexplorer.io/pot).

### Multi-Layered Approach to Scaling

Scalability refers to a network's ability to process high transaction volumes quickly and affordably. Cardano addresses this challenge through a multi-layered strategy. Layer 1 improvements, such as node upgrades, parameter adjustments, and network optimizations, enhance the base blockchain's performance.

Layer 2 solutions, like [Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/) and [Midgard](https://midgardprotocol.com/), process transactions off-chain and settle on the main blockchain as needed. This layered approach increases speed and capacity while preserving decentralization and keeping transaction fees low.

### Connects to Other Blockchains

Through a combination of sidechains, bridges, and atomic swaps, Cardano enables movement of digital assets to other blockchains. This interoperability strategy connects Cardano to both blockchain and traditional financial ecosystems. 

Cardano can interact with dozens of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ergo, and Midnight. Blockchains that follow Cardano's [Partner Chain framework](https://cardano.org/news/2024-08-01-first-release-of-the-partner-chains-toolkit/) can gain automatic interoperability and even borrow from Cardano's security to bootstrap their own blockchains.

### Third Generation

Bitcoin represents the first-generation of blockchains, a revolutionary invention that introduced decentralized cryptocurrency networks to the world. Ethereum is the first member of the second-generation, which added programmable smart contracts that allow for custom applications on the blockchain.

Cardano represents the third generation, which combines the best elements of Bitcoin (secure and decentralized sound money) and Ethereum (programmable smart contracts) while learning from both.
