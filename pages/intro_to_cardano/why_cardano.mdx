# Why Cardano?

Cardano is the first blockchain to evolve from scientific peer review and cryptographic research methods. It is one of the most enviroment friendly blockchain ecosystem available. With many scientists, mathematicians and developers working together it is safe to say that the Cardano ecosystem is going to improve over time.

### Decentralized

Cardano seeks to provide economic services for everyone by supporting applications for finance, creative property, identity, governance, and more.

### Backed by science
The first blockchain to be developed through scientific peer review and research-driven methods.

### Good for the planet

Environmentally friendly through the use of Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake algorithm to power its blockchain that maximizes energy efficiency.

### Scalable
Designed to be scalable for millions of users, sustainable to last for generations, and interoperable with legacy systems and other blockchain ecosystems

### Flexible
Faster, less expensive, and more predictable as a blockchain platform for individuals and businesses.

### Academic Foundation

There are many academic foundations related to works on Cardano such as Emurgo as well as the Cardano Academic foundations.

### Capped Supply and Predictable Monetary Policy

The currency used in the Cardano ecosystem is ADA.The circulating supply of ADA is around 36 billion now and the total supply is capped at 45billion.

### Programmable Smart Contracts

Cardano introduced smart contracts in 2021 and now supports the development and deployment of smart contracts using multiple different languages.

1. Aiken - for on-chain validator scripts only: a language & toolchain favouring developer experience.
2. Marlowe - a domain-specific language, it covers the world of financial contracts.
3. opshin - a programming language for generic Smart Contracts based on Python.
4. Plutus - a platform to write full applications that interact with the Cardano blockchain.
5. plu-ts - Typescript-embedded smart contract programming language and a transaction creation library.

### Superior Staking

Staking on Cardano is like helping out the digital money system and earning extra coins in return. Instead of spending your coins, you lock them up in a special place to help with transactions. It's safe because your coins stay in your wallet. Think of it like getting a little reward, similar to interest in a savings account. And the most interesting aspect is that you can unstake your coins or move out your coins at any time.

### Highly Reliable

Cardano is one of the few blockchains which hasn't had a downtime since its inception.

### Well-Defined Roadmap

The Cardano project has a well defined roadmap with 5 eras.The Eras was Byron Shelley,Goguen,Basho,Voltaire
