# Why Cardano?

As a scientifically-developed blockchain, Cardano offers a secure platform to bank and use decentralized services.

### Thorough Research

Beginning in 2015, [IOG](https://iohk.io/) partnered with over [30 top institutions](https://iohk.io/en/research/), including Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Edinburgh. These collaborations resulted in [200+ research papers](https://iohk.io/en/research/) that created the basis for Cardano's security, decentralization, and reliability.

IOG translated this academic research into Cardano's software using formal methods, including mathematical specifications, property-based testing, and proofs. This careful approach helps ensure that every part of the system works exactly as intended.

### Capped Supply and Predictable Monetary Policy

Cardano has a fixed maximum supply of 45 billion ADA, with over 35 billion already in circulation. Like Bitcoin, this hard cap creates digital scarcity and helps preserve value over time.

The remaining 10 billion ADA are strategically released as rewards to block producers (known as stake pools) using a [precise formula](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/monetary-policy/). As more blocks are created, the rewards gradually decrease, creating natural scarcity while maintaining network security.

### Fair Distribution

ADA stands out as one of the most equitably distributed cryptocurrencies. At launch, only [11.5%](https://cardano.org/genesis/) was allocated to founding entities for development and marketing, while the remaining 88.5% is designated for public circulation and future block rewards.

The Cardano network has an engaged community with over [85 million](https://cexplorer.io/article/how-many-ada-holders-are-there-in-the-world) ADA holders worldwide. This wide distribution is beneficial for robust decentralization, engaged governance, and a vibrant ecosystem.

### Real World Focus

Nearly 2 billion people—38% of adults globally—lack access to basic financial services. Cardano addresses this by offering a borderless financial system that enables anyone to participate in the digital economy.

Cardano powers projects tackling real-world challenges like [housing finance](https://empowa.io/), [decentralized communication](https://worldmobile.io/), and [sustainable supply chains](https://palmyra.app/). Its DeFi tools allow users to access essential services like lending, borrowing, and trading.

### Record of Reliability

Since its launch in 2017, Cardano has achieved over 2,300 consecutive days of 100% uptime—outperforming even tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.

This exceptional resilience is the result of thoughtful design decisions. These qualities make Cardano a trusted platform for global financial applications and an ideal place to build dependable systems.

### Environmentally Sound

Cardano leads the way in sustainable blockchain technology with its energy-efficient proof-of-stake design. Unlike proof-of-work systems, Cardano’s consensus mechanism drastically reduces energy consumption while maintaining the same [robust security guarantees as Bitcoin](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-a-provably-secure-proof-of-stake-blockchain-protocol/).

This eco-friendly approach makes Cardano a standout choice for those seeking a blockchain that prioritizes environmental sustainability. By combining low energy use with high security and scalability, Cardano proves that blockchain technology can evolve responsibly with our world.

### Be your own Bank

With Cardano, users can transact and store value without intermediaries. The network enshrines strong property rights and equal treatment directly into its constitution and code. This decentralized peer-to-peer nature promotes financial freedom.

Besides digital assets, Cardano also offers powerful identity tools, which can serve as an alternative to traditional IDs. These decentralized Identities (DIDs) provide a way for undocumented people to establish reputation and credentials, enabling new opportunities with loans, investments, real estate, employment, and more.

### Simple Staking

Cardano's innovative Proof-of-Stake mechanism enables users to earn rewards by delegating ADA to stake pools, which secure the network by creating blocks globally. The system works in a way that monetary incentives reinforce network security and decentralization.

Staking on Cardano combines security with convenience - users retain full control of their funds while earning rewards every 5 days. More than 60% of all ADA is staked, making it one of the most widely used methods to earn passive rewards on Cardano.

### Truly Decentralized

At the heart of Cardano's architecture lies a network of [2,500+ community-operated stake pools](https://adastat.net/pools) that maintain the blockchain. These nodes are distributed globally, ensuring resilience to regional disruptions. Its high decentralization is what makes Cardano credibly robust, secure, and neutral.

Decentralization isn’t just technical—Cardano’s democratic voting system puts the community in control. By allowing any ADA holder to participate in voting, it decentralizes the decision-making guiding Cardano's evolution.

### Programmable Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that happen when predefined conditions are met. These contracts form the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps). Smart contracts operate with unchangeable code, ensuring consistent and impartial execution for all users.

The applications of smart contracts on Cardano are vast and transformative. They enable decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, marketplaces, games, voting, and many more. Beyond these, the innovative potential of smart contracts continues to expand, promising advancements that have yet to be conceived.

### Great Place to Build

Cardano stands out as a premier blockchain platform to build, due to its open-source, peer-reviewed foundation and commitment to security. This approach provides a solid foundation for developers to build upon, knowing that the underlying system has been rigorously tested and validated.

There are a [wealth of dApps](https://www.cardanocube.com/cardano-ecosystem-interactive-map) live and in development on Cardano. Development is being driven by intuitive developer tools and multiple established smart contract languages. These factors make Cardano an attractive choice to build decentralized applications.

### Democratic Governance

Cardano's governance puts Cardano's evolution in the hands of its community. Every ADA holder can either vote directly, or delegate their vote, to weigh in on network updates and funding allocations.

This model helps ensure that the network remains sustainable long-term. It also fuels community participation, as people have a say in the direction of the network. Finally, it helps ensure the evolution of the network reflects the interests of the community at large.

### Engaged Community

Since its 2017 launch, Cardano has established itself as a leading blockchain network with a global user base in the tens of millions. It consistently ranks among the top 10 by market cap and supports thousands of projects.

At the heart of Cardano lies a passionate and multifaceted community. Members engage deeply across various spheres - from [Project Catalyst's](https://projectcatalyst.io/) innovation hub to [Intersect's](https://www.intersectmbo.org/) working groups. Together, they drive Cardano’s mission to create a thriving decentralized economy.

### Diverse Ecosystem

Over the last few years Cardano has seen a diverse explosion of projects launching, including DeFi, identity, NFTs, social media, telecom, AI, gaming, computing and much more. This variety constitutes the basis for a healthy and sustainable digital economy, where users can find everything they need in one place.

Some of the most promising Cardano projects are utilizing the Cardano platform to revolutionize existing industries. Some of these projects include [World Mobile](https://worldmobile.io/) to revolutionize telecom, [Book.io](https://book.io/) to disrupt publishing, and [Axo Finance](https://www.axo.trade/) to create better trading platforms.

### Open-Source Ethos

The code behind Cardano is [open source](https://github.com/IntersectMBO). This builds trust because anyone can see exactly how the platform is built. It also allows any potential issues to be found and resolved quickly.

The custodian of the source code is the [Intersect Organization](https://www.intersectmbo.org/), which coordinates community members to maintain Cardano's core technology and creates a roadmap for the future. Intersect serves as a central hub for community discussion, governance, and development within the Cardano community.

### Roadmap

Cardano has a well-defined roadmap with 5 major stages. The stages can be simplified as:

1. [Cardano's Launch](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/byron/)
2. [Improved Decentralization](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/shelley/)
3. [Introduction of Smart Contracts](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/)
4. [Scaling the Blockchain](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/basho/)
5. [Introduction of Governance](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/)

Stages 1 through 3 are mostly complete, though improvements continue. Now the focus is on stage 4 and 5. Stage 4, known as Basho, aims to improve scalability so Cardano can process more transactions and serve more users. Stage 5, known as Voltaire, enables democratic governance so that users can vote to help decide Cardano's future. Read the [full roadmap here](https://roadmap.cardano.org/).

### Treasury

The second element of sustainability is the Cardano Treasury. This is a substantial fund of ADA that is set aside for the growth of Cardano. Once governance is implemented it will be managed by the Cardano community who can vote on how to deploy treasury funds. The treasury is self-sustaining because it receives a small percentage of ADA from the fees of each transaction, and from block rewards. As the Cardano grows the treasury grows as well. See the [current state of the treasury here](https://cexplorer.io/pot).

### Scaling and Partner Chains

Scalability refers to the ability of the network to handle large volumes of transactions quickly and cheaply. The Cardano network has been designed from the start with scalability in mind. The current transaction throughput is sufficient for now, but once Cardano gains further adoption it will need to employ more scaling solutions.

There are initiatives underway to improve Cardano's scalability while preserving decentralization. These include [Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/), [input endorsers](https://cexplorer.io/article/understanding-input-endorsers), sidechains, and layer 2s. Scaling will be achieved through multiple strategies, giving users the option to use whatever makes sense for them. [See details about some scaling strategies here](https://cardano-scaling.org/).

Interoperability is the property of being able to transfer value to and from other blockchains outside Cardano ecosystem. It also relates to interfacing with the traditional financial system. This is important because it facilitates the flow of money between platforms and improves the blockchain experience for users.

One major initiative that is aiming to solve this is the "side chain" or "partner chain" framework that being added to Cardano. This framework allows other custom blockchains to be created that can interact seamlessly with Cardano. As an example, [Midnight](https://midnight.network/) is a Cardano partner chain that is built to protect sensitive data for business use cases. Partner chains have custom features that make them more suitable for certain uses. With partner chains, assets can be sent freely between these chains and the Cardano blockchain.

### Bright Future Ahead

Cardano's identity solutions also give individuals greater ownership of their personal data than the current system. As things stand, it is normal for companies to hold their user's personal information even though they often sell it, use it in bad ways, or lose it in data breaches. Identity solutions provide a new model in which you are the owner of your identity information and can share more their information more selectively, or even prove eligibility (for example, that they are older than 18) without sharing any personal information whatsoever using powerful zero-knowledge proof technology.

See [Atala Prism](https://atalaprism.io/) and the [Identity Wallet](https://identity.cardanofoundation.org) for an intro to Cardano identify solutions.

Bitcoin represents the first-generation of blockchain, which introduced secure and decentralized cryptocurrency networks to the world.

Ethereum is the first of the second-generation blockchains, which added programmability and smart contract capabilities. This allowed users to interact with custom applications on the blockchain.

Cardano represents the third generation, which combines the best elements of Bitcoin (secure and decentralized sound money) and Ethereum (programmable smart contracts) while learning from the missteps of both.

Cardano's founder Charles Hoskinson designed Cardano to specifically make improvements in the areas of interoperability, scalability, and sustainability. Read a summary of each below, or read about these concepts in [Cardano's documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/why-use-cardano/).

Cardano's development continues on many fronts. There are ongoing efforts to improve Cardano's speed, resilience, privacy, governance, developer experience, and much more. The future of Cardano is bright and the community is welcoming. Feel free to get involved!
