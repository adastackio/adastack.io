# Getting Started On-Chain

The steps to start using the Cardano blockchain: 

<Steps>
### Set up a Wallet
A wallet allows you to interact with the Cardano blockchain. It is useful for holding and sending digital assets and using Cardano Dapps. 

**Choosing a Wallet**

__Important things to know about wallets__
1. Be very careful where you download the wallet from. 
2. Your money is on the blockchain, not in your wallet. Your wallet is just a way of interacting with it. In fact, you could have multiple wallets that you use for different purposes. 
3. It is a very good idea to get a hardware wallet. 



### Buy ADA
ADA is available to buy on many Centralized Exchanges (CEXs).
