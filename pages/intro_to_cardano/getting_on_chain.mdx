# Getting Started On-Chain

Getting on chain means getting set up and starting to use the blockchain. Here are the steps to start using Cardano: 

<Steps>
### Set up a Wallet
A wallet allows you to interact with the Cardano blockchain. It is useful to hold digital currencies, send and receive Cardano assets, and use Cardano applications (Dapps).

**Important things to know about wallets**
1. Make sure you are downloading the wallet from the official website. Scammers sometimes make fake wallet websites to trick users into downloading bad software. You can check use sites like [CardanoCube](https://www.cardanocube.io/collections/wallets) and [BuiltOnCardano](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/wallets) to find the official wallet website.  
2. When creating a wallet you will write down a list of words known as a seed phrase. This is the master key to your funds. Don't share this with anyone, don't sore it online, and make sure to hold it securely. Here are some additional [seed phrase tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/wiki/wallets/seedphrase/).
3. It is recommended to get a hardware wallet if you want maximum security. These are physical devices that require the owner to enter a code into the device anytime they are sending funds from their account. [See HW wallet options here](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/hardware-wallet). 

### Buy ADA
ADA is available to buy on many Centralized Exchanges (CEXs).

It is recommended to use a strong password and 2FA for your exchange account for security.

### Use the Cardano Network
Once you have a wallet with some ADA in it there are many options available to you:  
- Send and receive assets
- Stake your ADA  
- Trade for other tokens on a decentralized exchange (DEX)  
- Use decentralized application (Dapp)  
- Buy an NFT on an NFT marketplace
