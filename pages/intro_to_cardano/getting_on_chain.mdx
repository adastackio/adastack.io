# Getting Started On-Chain

The steps to start using the Cardano blockchain: 

<Steps>
### Set up a Wallet
A wallet allows you to interact with the Cardano blockchain. It is useful for holding and sending digital assets and using Cardano Dapps. 

**Choosing a Wallet**

[All Wallet Options]() : Browse websites with all the Cardano wallets.  

__Important things to know about wallets__
1. Make sure you are downloading the wallet from the authentic website. 
2. You will need to save a list of words known as a seed phrase, which is the key to your funds. Store this carefully and securely. Here are some [seed phrase tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/wiki/wallets/seedphrase/).
3. Your money is on the blockchain, not in your wallet. Your wallet is just a way of interacting with it. You could have multiple wallets managing with the same account. 
4. It is recommended to get a hardware wallet for large values of cryptocurrency because it requires signing a physical device to move funds. 

### Buy ADA
ADA is available to buy on many Centralized Exchanges (CEXs).
