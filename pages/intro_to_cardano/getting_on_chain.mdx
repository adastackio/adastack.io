# Getting Started On-Chain

The steps to start using the Cardano blockchain: 

<Steps>
### Set up a Wallet
A wallet allows you to interact with the Cardano blockchain. It is useful for holding digital currencies, buying and selling digital assets, and using Cardano Dapps. 

**Choosing a Wallet**

**Important things to know about wallets**
1. Make sure you are downloading the wallet from the official wallet website. Sometimes scammers will make wallet websites to trick users into downloading bad software. You can cross-check against the URLs on sites like [CardanoCube](https://www.cardanocube.io/collections/wallets) and [BuiltOnCardano](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/wallets).  
2. When creating a wallet you will receive a list of words known as a seed phrase. This is the master key to your funds. Don't share this with anyone and store it securely. Here are some more [seed phrase tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/wiki/wallets/seedphrase/).
3. It is recommended to get a hardware wallet if you want maximum security. HW wallets are physical devices that require the owner to enter a code into the device anytime they are sending funds from their account. [See some options here](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/hardware-wallet). 

### Buy ADA
ADA is available to buy on many Centralized Exchanges (CEXs).

[Cardano on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/how-to-buy/cardano)  

It is recommended to use a strong password and 2FA for your exchange account for security. 

Once you have purchased your ADA on an exchange you can send it to your wallet. [Here is a guide](https://help.sundaeswap.finance/en/articles/5852067-how-to-transfer-your-ada-to-a-non-custodial-wallet) for sending from an exchange to a wallet. 


### Use the Cardano Network
Once you have a wallet with some ADA in it there are many options available to you:  
- Stake your ADA  
- Trade for other tokens on a decentralized exchange (DEX)  
- Use decentralized application (dApp)  
- Buy an NFT
