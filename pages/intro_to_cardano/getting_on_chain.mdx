#### Download a wallet
[This guide](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/how-to-choose-a-web3-wallet) from Essential Cardano discusses some important considerations when choosing a Cardano wallet. There are many options out there. 
  
Some of the top open-source options for Cardano are [Lace](https://www.lace.io/), [Nami](https://namiwallet.io/), and the full-node wallet [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/).  
For added security, you may want to consider a cold wallet such as [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/).
