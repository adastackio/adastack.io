# Getting Started On-Chain

Getting on-chain means starting to use the Cardano network. Here are the steps to get started: 

<Steps>
### Set up a Wallet
A wallet allows you to interact with the Cardano blockchain. It can store digital assets, make and receive transactions, and interact with applications on Cardano (known as Dapps). 

#### Choose a Wallet 
These resources give some useful advice for choosing a wallet. If you just want to get started quickly, some great options are [Lace wallet](https://www.lace.io/) for browser and [Vespr wallet](https://vespr.xyz/) for mobile. You can always switch later.

#### Important Things to Know 
- When creating a wallet you receive a list of words known as a seed phrase. This is the master key to your funds. Write it down, keep it safe, don't share it, and don't store it online. Here are more [seed phrase tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/wiki/wallets/seedphrase/).
- Make sure you are downloading the wallet from the official website because scammers sometimes make fake websites to trick users. You can double-check the URL on [CardanoCube](https://www.cardanocube.io/collections/wallets) and [BuiltOnCardano](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/wallets).  
- If you want maximum security then it is recommended to get a hardware wallet. These devices store your crypto offline. They require you to enter a code into the device anytime you are sending funds or using an application. Because of these precautions they are one of the safest ways to hold cryptocurrency. [See Cardano hardware wallet options here](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/hardware-wallet).  

### Buy ADA
ADA is available to buy on many Centralized Exchanges (CEXs). You can choose one that is available in your country and make an account. 

#### Choosing an Exchange

[Cardano on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/how-to-buy/cardano)  

It is recommended to use a strong password and 2FA for your exchange account for security. 

#### Make an order
You can buy at the current price by using a "market order" or set a price you'd want to buy at using a "limit order". There are some other order types too that you might use if you are trading. You can [read more](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/crypto-order-types-101-from-market-to-limit/) about order types.

#### Send to your Wallet
Once you have purchased your ADA on an exchange you can send it to your wallet. [This guide explains](https://help.sundaeswap.finance/en/articles/5852067-how-to-transfer-your-ada-to-a-non-custodial-wallet) how to send ADA from an exchange to a wallet. 

### Use the Cardano Network
Once you have a wallet with some ADA in it there are many options available to you:  
- Send and receive assets
- Stake your ADA  
- Trade for other tokens on a decentralized exchange (DEX)  
- Use decentralized application (Dapp)  
- Buy an NFT on an NFT marketplace
