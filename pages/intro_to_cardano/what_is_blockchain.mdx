# What is Blockchain?

Blockchain technology (BCT) has garnered global attention over the past decade, captivating researchers, industrialists, and academicians. Initially synonymous with digital currency or cryptocurrency, blockchain has since evolved into one of the most promising, disruptive, and revolutionary technologies. Its impact extends beyond finance, transforming domains like banking, healthcare, and government.

## The Concept of Blockchain

Blockchain operates as a decentralized, distributed ledger comprising a chain of consecutive blocks that store transactions. Unlike traditional client/server systems, BCT thrives on decentralization, empowering participants within a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Nodes, the computers in the network, maintain copies of the digital ledger, ensuring transparency and redundancy.

## Structure and Security

Blockchain is an ever-growing chain of interconnected blocks, protected by cryptographic functions. Validation of new blocks relies on protocols and consensus among all participants. Records are stored in a linear chain using pointers and linked list data structures. Blocks are arranged in sequential order and interconnected through pointers, with each block containing a header, block body, transaction details, timestamps, and links to the previous block.

## Why is Blockchain Important

Blockchainâ€™s impact extends far beyond cryptocurrency. Industries like finance, supply chain, healthcare, and government are exploring its potential. Its decentralized nature, transparency, and enhanced security make it an appealing solution for streamlining processes, reducing fraud, and ensuring data integrity.

## What can you do with Blockchain?

Blockchain applications are characterized by consensus, distributed computation, immutability, and authentication. Various types of blockchains cater to different needs. Permissionless/public blockchains allow unrestricted reading and writing, while permissioned ledgers restrict access to authenticated users. Consortium blockchains combine public and private elements, offering flexibility and governance options.

## Software Architecture Perspective

Understanding the working model of blockchain is crucial for successful implementation. Transactions are initiated by a party creating a block. The block is then validated by network computers and added to the chain, ensuring transparency and security. This architecture offers opportunities for improved efficiency and trust among participants.
