#### Fund the Exchange

To fund your exchange account you'll first link it to your bank account or another funding method. Follow the instructions on your exchange to do this. Once it is linked you can fund send money into the exchange to prepare to trade.

#### Make a Purchase Order

Once you have money on the exchange you can set an order. You can buy at the current price by using a "market order". If you want to try and get a lower price you can set a specific low price using a "limit order", in which case the order will execute if ADA hits that price. There are some other [order types](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/crypto-order-types-101-from-market-to-limit/) too but they are not really needed to get started.
