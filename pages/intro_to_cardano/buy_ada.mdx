# Buy ADA

## Buy ADA on an Exchange

The most common way to buy ADA is through Centralized Exchanges (CEXs). These platforms are designed for trading cryptocurrencies and digital assets.

**Security Tips**

- Use a strong password and two factor authentication (2FA) for added security.
- Use an exchange with a great reputation for security, some have been hacked.
- CEXs have custody over your digital assets until you send them to your wallet.

<Steps>
### Choose an Exchange

Be sure to check if the exchange is available in your country. Here are some additional [considerations when choosing an exchange](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/au/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-cardano-ada/).

### Create an Account

To create a new account, follow the steps on the exchange to register. Part of this process is providing Know Your Customer (KYC) information.

### Fund your Account

To fund your exchange account you'll follow the exchange's instructions to link it with your bank account. Once it is linked you can fund your exchange account from your bank. You are ready to buy!

### Purchase ADA

After funding your account, you can proceed to purchase ADA.

Several [order types](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/crypto-order-types-101-from-market-to-limit/) are available for traders. These are the simplest and most common ones:  
**Limit order**: Set your desired purchase price
**Market order**: Instant execution at current price  
**Dollar Cost Average**: Recurring buys at the current price

Limit orders usually have the lowest fees, it is recommended to check the fees on your exchange though.

### Send the ADA to your Wallet

Once you have purchased your ADA on an exchange you can send it to your wallet. [This guide explains](https://help.sundaeswap.finance/en/articles/5852067-how-to-transfer-your-ada-to-a-non-custodial-wallet) how to send ADA from an exchange to a wallet.

## Other Ways to Acquire ADA

Centralized Exchanges are the most common way to buy ADA, but you can also receive it in other ways.

- **Receive payment in ADA**. If you are doing work in the Cardano ecosystem you can potentially receive payment in ADA.
- **Earn funding from Catalyst**. [Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/) is an innovation engine for Cardano. ADA holders vote on proposals they want to fund, and funded proposals get paid in ADA.
- **Buy it using your wallet**. Some wallets have features to purchase crypto with a debit/credit card, bank transfer, or Apple Pay. Note that fees are usually higher than buying on an exchange.
- **Buy ADA privately**. For enhanced privacy, you can look at [buying Bitcoin anonymously](https://kycnot.me/), then convert it to ADA using a cross-chain DEX. Check the legality in your location first.
