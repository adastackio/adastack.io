# Buy ADA

## Buy ADA on an Exchange

The most common way to buy ADA is through Centralized Exchanges (CEXs). These platforms are designed for users to trade between traditional currency and cryptocurrencies.

<Steps>
### Choose an Exchange

Different exchanges operate in different countries, so ensure that your choice is available in yours. Here are more [considerations for choosing an exchange](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/au/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-cardano-ada/).

**ADA Exchanges**:

- [ADA Markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/#Markets): All exchanges trading ADA, ranked by daily trading volume.
- [Cardano on Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/learn/buy-cardano-ada): US-based exchange operating since 2011.
- [Cardano on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/how-to-buy/cardano): US-based exchange operating since 2012.
- [Cardano on Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/how-to-buy/cardano): Largest cryptocurrency exchange operating since 2017.

_Pro tip:_ Choose an exchange with a strong reputation for security.

### Create an Account

To set up an account, follow the steps provided by the exchange. Part of this process may be identity verification, known as KYC (Know Your Customer). This step may require verification documents - typically a government-issued photo ID and proof of address (like a utility bill).

Most exchanges verify your identity within 24-48 hours, though some may take longer during busy periods. Once verified, your account will be ready to fund your account.

_Pro tip:_ Use a strong password and set up two factor authentication (2FA) for security.

### Fund your Account

To fund your account you'll need to link it to an existing bank account. Follow the steps provided on your exchange to connect them.

Once your bank is linked, you can transfer money to your exchange account. Choose your preferred payment method - bank transfers are usually free but take 3-5 days, while debit cards are instant but charge higher fees. Enter the amount you want to deposit and confirm the transaction.

_Pro tip:_ Start with a small test transfer to verify everything works correctly before making larger deposits.

### Purchase ADA

After funding your account, you can proceed to purchase ADA by making an order.

There are several [order types](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/crypto-order-types-101-from-market-to-limit/) available.

These are the most common order types:  
**Market order**: Instant execution at current price.  
**Limit order**: Set your desired purchase price.  
**Dollar Cost Average**: Recurring buys at the current price.

_Pro tip:_ Limit orders usually have the lowest fees. It is recommended to check the fees on your exchange.

### Send the ADA to your Wallet

Once you have purchased your ADA on an exchange you can send it to your wallet. [This guide explains](https://help.sundaeswap.finance/en/articles/5852067-how-to-transfer-your-ada-to-a-non-custodial-wallet) how to send ADA from an exchange to a wallet.

_Pro tip:_ Centralized exchanges control your digital assets until you withdraw them to your personal wallet.

## Other Ways to Acquire ADA

Centralized Exchanges are the most common way to buy ADA, but you can also receive it in other ways.

- **Receive payment in ADA**. If you are doing work in the Cardano ecosystem you can potentially receive payment in ADA.
- **Earn funding from Catalyst**. [Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/) is an innovation engine for Cardano. ADA holders vote on proposals they want to fund, and funded proposals get paid in ADA.
- **Buy it using your wallet**. Some wallets have features to purchase crypto with a debit/credit card, bank transfer, or Apple Pay. Note that fees are usually higher than buying on an exchange.
- **Buy ADA privately**. For enhanced privacy, you can look at [buying Bitcoin anonymously](https://kycnot.me/), then convert it to ADA using a cross-chain DEX. Check the legality in your location first.
