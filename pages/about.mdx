# â‚³bout

Adastack aims to showcase many of the tools and resources within the quickly growing Cardano ecosystem.

This website is created by Tucker Triggs. I built this project to help map this quickly growing ecosystem because I believe in the [global misson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTVrUOFXIT0) of Cardano. 

It is not an endorsement of these projects and you should use common sense when using any website or dapp. You might find these websites useful to analyze risks.

If you want to support the project, feel free to drop a donation to $adastack, buy me a coffee, or [hire me](https://www.tuckertriggs.com/contact) to help build your website or Dapp.
