# â‚³bout

Adastack aims to be a living map of tools, resources, and Dapps available to use on Cardano. You can use it to find what is available in the quickly-growing ecosystem. 

This website is created by [Tucker Triggs](https://www.tuckertriggs.com/). It will be soon be made open-source to enable community contributions. Follow [Adastack GitHub](https://github.com/adastackio) for updates on that. 

Please use common sense when using any website or Dapp. [These websites]() can be useful to better understand the risk profiles for various Cardano projects.

If you want to support the project then vote for us in Catalyst Fund 12. We deeply appreciate your support! You can also follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adastackio) where we will post Cardano tools and updates about the project.
