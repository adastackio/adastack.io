Adastack aims to be a comprehensive directory for navigating the Cardano ecosystem. 

This website is created originally by Tucker Triggs. This is a project I created out of love for the Cardano network and community. I do not intend to put ads, trackers, or anything like that on the site. 

If you want to support the project, feel free to drop a donation to $adastack. 

If you want to hire me for Cardano dapp development, reach out via my email or [contact page](https://www.tuckertriggs.com/contact).
