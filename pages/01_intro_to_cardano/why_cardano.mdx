# Why Cardano?

Cardano is a robust and fully-featured blockchain network. Read about the main features of the Cardano blockchain: 

### Real World Focus 
Cardano's community and builders are uniquely focused on making real positive impact. Around 2 billion people, or 38% of adults, lack access to basic financial services. Cardano provides an alternative financial system that is inclusive, global, and fair. Anyone can use it to store value, make and receive transactions, and utilize decentralized finance (DeFi) to make investments or take out loans. 

Cardano's founder, Charles Hoskinson, has been discussing these topics for at least a decade, including in [this TED talk from 2014](https://youtu.be/97ufCT6lQcY). To this end, Cardano is pioneering a category of applications aimed at building financial inclusion called "RealFi". Some notable RealFi projects include [Empowa](https://empowa.io/), [World Mobile](https://worldmobile.io/), [Pezesha](https://pezesha.com/), [Commonlands](https://www.commonlands.org/), and [Palmyra](https://www.zengate.global/products/palmyra-comdex). 

### Research-Backed
The open-source software behind Cardano was created using a rigorous academic approach. [Input Output Global](https://iohk.io/) (the company behind Cardano's development) initially spent two years researching the ideal properties of a blockchain, with the goal of designing a system that is secure, decentralized, and reliable. They worked closely with experts at more than 30 top institutiuons and universities including Stanford, Carnegie Melon, University of Edinburgh, [and many more](https://iohk.io/en/research/) and published more than 200 [research papers](https://iohk.io/en/research/) which provide the scientific underpinnings for the Cardano blockchain. 

To turn these concepts into software, IOG employed a process of formal methods that includes mathematical specifications, property-based tests, and proofs. This development method provides strong guarantees of the correctness of the system's basic components. Cardano's code has also been [independently audited](https://github.com/input-output-hk/external_audits).

### Decentralized 
Cardano is the most decentralized of the major blockchains. Cardano's ledger is maintained and updated by 3000+ community-operated nodes known as stake pools. Important decisions such as network upgrades must be collectively approved by stake pools consensus. This means that that decisions are made by network participants and no single entity has direct control over the network. 

Stake pools are located all over the world, which allows Cardano to remain adaptable and continue operating even in the face of unexpected disruptions as long as honest nodes have more than more than 50% of the staked value delegated to them at any time. Due to this dynamic nature, it is nearly impossible to disrupt or tamper with the Cardano ledger. Even in extreme situations such as an internet outage or government ban the network can be trusted to continue operating. 

[See statistics about Cardano's decentralization compared to other top blockchains.](http://blockchainlab.inf.ed.ac.uk/edi-dashboard/)

### Democratic Governance
Democratic governance is a key element in the long-term strategy of Cardano. It puts decisions about Cardano's future in the hands of ADA holders. These users can create and vote on proposals that will determine the evolution of Cardano. The goal is that the network will reflect and adapt to the needs of its users as it progresses into the future. 

Governance is [in the process of being implemented](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/). The plan includes a system of checks and balances to protect from any individual or group from gaining too much power. Read more about [Cardano governance here](https://www.1694.io/).

### Permissionless
Much like the internet, Cardano is an open network, where anyone can use or build on it without needing permission. It is available to everyone with an internet connection to use.

This allows anyone to send, receive, store value, and more without needing the approval of any third party or government. Transactions happen directly between users, with no middleman to take fees. Transactions cannot be denied and assets cannot be frozen. For people living in repressive regimes, Cardano is a powerful tool that gives them access to a fair and global financial system where they cannot have their assets taken. These rights are enshrined directly into the code. 

### Capped Supply and Predictable Monetary Policy
Cardano has a maximum supply of 45 billion ADA. More than 35 billion of this ADA is already in circulation. The ADA that is not in circulation yet is held in reserve and released as rewards for stake pools when they produce a block. The supply mechanics are well-defined; Cardano uses a formula to determine supply emissions. [Read more about supply and monetary policy.](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/monetary-policy/)

ADA is also among the most fairly distributed at cryptocurrencies at launch. When Cardano was launched, 11.5% was set aside for the founding entities to develop and market the blockchain. The other 88.5% is either in active circulation by Cardano users, or is set aside for future block rewards. ADA that is currently in circulation is widely distributed; it is estimated that there are over [85 million ADA holders](https://cexplorer.io/article/how-many-ada-holders-are-there-in-the-world) worldwide. This wide distribution promotes decentralization, increases options for access, and leads to diverse and active participation. [Read more about the initial distribution here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano/tokenomics).

### Environmentally-Friendly 
There are multiple ways that blockchains come to agreement about what is the correct state of the blockchain. These are known as consensus mechanisms. Cardano operates using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. This is a good choice for energy efficiency because this uses a tiny fraction of the energy of Bitcoin's proof-of-work while still enjoying the same security guarantees. 

Cardano is over 200,000x more energy-efficient than Bitcoin. Check out the [latest statistics](https://cexplorer.io/energy) on Cardano's energy use. 

### Superior Staking
Cardano's Proof-of-Stake design is one of the best in crypto. The concept of staking is that you point your ADA to a block producing "stake pool" that you trust. The value of stake delegated to a given stake pool is how the Ouroboros mechanism determines which pool should mint the next block to the blockchain (for which they receive a monetary reward). Staking provides security to the Cardano system because it makes it extremely expensive for dishonest nodes to overcome honest stake pools and attack the Cardano system. 

Users benefit from staking ADA because they receive rewards every 5 days. Staked ADA never leaves your wallet and can be spent freely anytime. Users can stake using as little as 2 ADA. [Over 60% of ADA currently in circulation is staked](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/k5r9B?s=huXqeQmi9qA). This broad participation contributes to the healthy security and decentralization of the network. Furthermore, the ongoing rewards from staking make ADA an attractive long-term asset to hold.   

[Learn more about staking here](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation/) and [see how much ADA you could earn from staking](https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator).

### Identity-Focused
Identity refers to the ability for users to build financial reputation from their activity on the blockchain. This is important because around 2 billion people are undocumented (meaning they don't have an official ID) and/or unbanked (meaning they are excluded from accessing financial services). Cardano's identity solutions provide an alternative method for these users to build a digital track record and gain access to financial opportunities inculding loans, investments, real estate, job opportunities, and more. 

Cardano's identity solutions also give individuals greater ownership of their personal data than in the current system. As things stand, it is normal for companies to hold on to large amounts of personal information even though they often sell it, use it in bad ways, or lose it in data breaches. Identity solutions provide a new model in which you are the owner of your identity information and can share more selectively, or even prove something (for example, that you are old enough to use a service) without sharing any personal information using zero-knowledge proof technology. 

See [Atala Prism](https://atalaprism.io/) and the [Identity Wallet](https://identity.cardanofoundation.org) for an intro to Cardano identify solutions. 

### Well-Established
Cardano was launched in 2017, making it one of the more well-established crypto networks. Since launching, Cardano has almost always remained in the top 10 by market cap and has developed a global user base in the millions. It is one of the most widely held and traded crypto assets with [thousands of projects building on it](https://www.essentialcardano.io/development-update). It even ranked higher than Bitcoin for [brand intimacy](https://finbold.com/cardano-is-highest-ranking-crypto-brand-in-the-latest-top-brand-intimacy-2022-report/).

This wide availability and recognition gives Cardano and diverse base of users that contribute to its vibrant ecosystem and active governance. 

### Highly Reliable 
Cardano has had over 2000 days of 100% uptime since it launch in 2017. This is better than well-known companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. It is also better than many competing blockchains. Cardano has never had a restart, rollback, or fork. 

This resilience is a result of the thoughtful design and high decentralization of Cardano. This robust foundation makes it well-suited for its role as a global financial platform, and a great place to build applications that require high availability. 

### Open-Source
The code behind Cardano is [open source](https://github.com/IntersectMBO). This builds trust because anyone can see exactly how the platform is built. It also allows any potential issues to be found and resolved quickly. 

The custodian of the source code is [Intersect](https://www.intersectmbo.org/), which is an organization that brings together community members to maintain Cardano's core technology and maintain a roadmap for the future. Intersect serves as a central hub for community discussion, governance, and development within the Cardano community. 

### Great Place to Build 
Much like the internet, blockchains are open systems that anyone can build projects on without permission. This allows for organic innovation as people create novel solutions to a variety of the world's problems. 

Cardano has a rapidly growing ecosystem of Dapps (decentralized applications). Dapp builders benefit from building on a platform with predictable transaction fees and an engaged community. Hundreds of projects have already launched and 1300+ more are in development. [Explore available Dapps here](https://www.cardanocube.com/cardano-ecosystem-interactive-map).

### Programmable Smart Contracts
The biggest factor to Cardano's versatility and flourishing ecosystem are smart contracts. Smart contracts are digital agreements that execute automatically once the conditions within them them are met. 

Smart contracts are a great way to build contracts that are executed automatically by the blockchain. They also provide powerful building blocks to create more complex applications on Cardano. These applications (Dapps) have the benefit that they treat all users equally, as they are automated by unchangable code. They can be trusted to always execute as written. 

Here are a few examples of what you can create with smart contracts: 

- **Contracts in Code** — Self-executing agreements between parties that are transparent and don't require intermediaries such as banks or lawyers.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** — Financial applications including lending and borrowing platforms, prediction markets, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). 
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)** — A new structure of organization that allows users to make proposals, vote, manage a shared treasury, and take collective action to achieve a shared purpose. 
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)** — Identity solutions where users control their own data and can build reputation on the blockchain. 
- **Supply Chain Systems** — Blockchain-enabled supply chain systems allow businesses and consumers to see exactly where their goods come from.

Smart contracts are a versatile tool that you can use to create the items highlighte above, and many more. In fact, many uses haven't been invented yet. 

### Diverse Ecosystem
Over the last few years Cardano has seen a diverse explosion of projects launching, including DeFi, identity, NFTs, social media, telecom, AI, gaming, decentralized computing and much more. This variety constitutes the basis for a healthy and sustainable economy, where users can find everything they need in one place. 

Some of the most promising Cardano projects are using the Cardano platform to revolutionize existing industries. Some of these include [World Mobile](https://worldmobile.io/) for telecom, [Book.io](https://book.io/) for publishing, and [Axo Finance](https://www.axo.trade/) for advanced trading. 

### Engaged and Supportive Community 
Cardano has a committed and highly active community. Some of the main hubs of activity are [X](), [Twitter](), [Youtube](). There are also many [forums and discord channels]() you can check out to engage with the latest things happening within the ecosystem. 

### Ambitious and Well-Defined Roadmap
Cardano has a well-defined roadmap with 5 major stages. The stages can be simplified as: 
1. [Cardano Launch](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/byron/)
2. [Improve Decentralization](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/shelley/)
3. [Introduce Smart Contracts](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/)
4. [Scale the Blockchain](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/basho/) 
5. [Enable Governance](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/)

Stages 1 through 3 are mostly complete, though improvements continue. Now the focus is on stage 4 and 5. Stage 4, known as Basho, aims to improve scalability so the Cardano blockchain can handle more transactions and serve more users as it continues to grow. Stage 5, known as Voltaire, is about enabling democratic governance so that users can vote to help decide Cardano's future. Read the [full roadmap here](https://roadmap.cardano.org/).

### Quickly Improving Developer Environment
There is an increasing number of languages that can create smart contracts. They can now be written in [Haskell](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus), [Python](https://opshin.dev/), [TypeScript](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plu-ts), [Go](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/plutigo), as well as dedicated Cardano languages like [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/). Smart contracts can even be created in a visual drag-and-drop way using [Marlowe](https://marlowe-finance.io/). This diversity of options make Cardano increasingly accessible for developers from different backgrounds. 

Furthermore, additional development improvements are ongoing. Coding environments like [Demeter Run](https://demeter.run/), [Kuber IDE](https://kuberide.com/), and [Jambhala Dev Suite](https://github.com/iburzynski/jambhala) make it easy to get set up and start coding. Projects like [Lucid](https://lucid.spacebudz.io/) and [Mesh](https://meshjs.dev/) offer powerful building blocks for building  Dapps. [Plutus](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus), the original smart contract language, is undergoing continuous advancement and is adding new features. Design patterns and best practices are also being refined and standardized. 

### Third-Generation 
Bitcoin represents the first-generation of blockchain, which introduced secure and decentralized cryptocurrency networks to the world.

Ethereum is the original second-generation blockchain, which added programmability and smart contract capabilities. This allowed users to interact with custom applications on the blockchain. 

Cardano is the third generation, which combines the best elements of Bitcoin (secure and decentralized sound money) and Ethereum (programmable smart contracts) while learning from the missteps of both. 

Cardano's founder Charles Hoskinson designed Cardano to specifically make improvements in the areas of interoperability, scalability, and sustainability. Read a summary of each one below, or read about these concepts in Cardano's documentation [here](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/why-use-cardano/).

#### Interoperable 
Interoperability is the property of being able to transfer value to and from other blockchains outside Cardano ecosystem. It also relates to the ability to interface with the traditional financial system. This is important because it facilitates the flow of money between platforms and improves the blockchain experience for users. 

One major initiative that is aiming to solve this is the "side chain" or "partner chain" framework that being added to Cardano. This framework allows other custom blockchains to be created that can interact seamlessly with Cardano. As an example, [Midnight](https://midnight.network/) is a Cardano partner chain that is built to protect sensitive data for business applications. Partner chains often have custom features that make them especially suitable for a certain purpose. Due to the work on interoperability, assets can be sent between these partner chains and the Cardano blockchain. 

#### Scalable 
Scalability refers to increasing the amount speed and volume of transactions that is possible on the network. The Cardano network has been designed from the start with scalability in mind. 

The current Cardano network can handle many transactions while preserving decentralization. While this is sufficient for now, there are some initiatives in progress that will further the Cardano network's ability to handle additional transactions. These include [Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/), [input endorsers](https://cexplorer.io/article/understanding-input-endorsers), network parameter increases, side chains, and layer 2s. Multiple different strategies are being implemented so the network is ready it continues to gain adoption. 

#### Sustainable
Sustainability in this context means the ability of the network to have good incentives in order to adapt and remain competitive in the long-term. Cardano has two main mechanisms to remain sustainable and self-sufficient:

The first element of long-term sustainability is governance, which puts the control of the Cardano network in the hands of users. This improves Cardano's long-term trajectory because it means the Cardano network can continuously adapt to the needs and desires of users with tech advances and parameter changes. Governance empowers the community to be very engaged, allowing users to have a real stake in decision making process. 

The second element of sustainability is the Cardano treasury. This is a substantial fund of ADA that is set aside for the growth of Cardano and its ecosystem. Once governance is implemented it will be managed by the Cardano community who can vote on how to best deploy treasury funds. The treasury is self-sustaining because it receives a small percentage of ADA from transaction fees and from block rewards. As the Cardano grows the treasury continues to grow as well. See the [current state of the treasury here](https://cexplorer.io/pot). 

### Forward-looking 
Cardano's development continues on many fronts. There are ongoing efforts to improve Cardano's speed, resilience, privacy, governance, developer experience, and much more. The future of Cardano is bright and the community is welcoming. Feel free to get involved!
