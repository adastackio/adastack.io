# Why Cardano?

Cardano is a robust and fully-featured blockchain network. Read about the main features of the Cardano blockchain: 

### Decentralized 
Cardano is the most decentralized major blockchain. The Cardano ledger is maintained and updated by 3000+ community-operated nodes known as stake pools. Important decisions such as upgrades must be collectively approved by stake pools consensus, meaning that decisions are made by network participants and no single entity has direct control over the network. 

Because stake pools are located all over the world, Cardano is able to remain adaptable and continue operating even in the face of unexpected disruptions as long as more than 50% of the value staked to these nodes at any time remain honest. Due to this dynamic nature, it is nearly impossible to disrupt or tamper with the Cardano ledger. Even in extreme situations such as an internet outage or government ban the network can be trusted to continue operating.

### Real World Focus 
Cardano's community and builders are uniquely focused on making real positive impact. Around 2 billion people, or 38% of adults, lack access to basic financial services. Cardano provides an alternative financial system that is inclusive, global, and fair. Anyone can use it to store value, make and receive transactions, and utilize decentralized finance (DeFi) to make investments or take out loans. 

Cardano's founder, Charles Hoskinson, has [been discussing these topics for at least a decade](https://youtu.be/97ufCT6lQcY). To this end, Cardano is pioneering a category of applications aimed at building financial inclusion called "RealFi". Some notable RealFi projects include [Empowa](https://empowa.io/), [World Mobile](https://worldmobile.io/), [Pezesha](https://pezesha.com/), [Commonlands](https://www.commonlands.org/), and [Palmyra](https://www.zengate.global/products/palmyra-comdex). 

### Research-Backed
The open-source software behind Cardano was created using a rigorous academic approach. [Input Output Global](https://iohk.io/) (the company behind Cardano's development) initially spent two years researching the ideal properties of a blockchain, with the goal of designing a system that is secure, decentralized, and reliable. They worked closely with experts at more than 30 top institutiuons and universities including Stanford, Carnegie Melon, University of Edinburgh, [and many more](https://iohk.io/en/research/) and published more than 200 [research papers](https://iohk.io/en/research/) which provide the scientific underpinnings for the Cardano blockchain. 

To turn these concepts into software, IOG employed a process of formal methods that includes mathematical specifications, property-based tests, and proofs. This development method provides strong guarantees of the correctness of the system's basic components. Cardano's code has also been [independently audited](https://github.com/input-output-hk/external_audits).

### Democratic Governance
Democratic governance is a key element to the long-term viability of Cardano. It puts key decisions about Cardano's future in the hands of holders of Cardano's base currency ADA. ADA holders can create and vote on proposals that will determine the evolution of Cardano. The goal is that the network will reflect and adapt to the needs of its users into the future. 

Governance is [in the process of being implemented](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/). The governance system includes checks and balances to protect from any individual or group from gaining too much power. Read more about the [plan for governance here](https://www.1694.io/).

### Permissionless
Much like the internet, Cardano is an open network, where anyone can use or build on it without needing permission. It is available to everyone with an internet connection to use.

This allows anyone to send, receive, store value, and more without needing the approval of any third party or government. Transactions happen directly between users, with no middleman to take additional fees. Transactions cannot be denied and assets cannot be frozen. For people living in repressive regimes, Cardano is a powerful tool that gives them immediate access to a fair and global financial system where they cannot be sanctioned or have their assets taken. These rights are enshrined directly into the code. 

### Capped Supply and Predictable Monetary Policy
Cardano has a maximum supply of 45 billion ADA. More than 35 billion of this is in circulation. The ADA that is not in circulation yet is held in reserve and released as rewards to stake pools when they produce a block. The supply mechanics are well-defined; Cardano uses a formula to determine supply emissions. [Read more about the monetary policy.](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/monetary-policy/)

ADA is also among the most fairly distributed at cryptocurrencies at launch. When it was launched, 11.5% was set aside for the founding entities to develop and market the blockchain. The rest is either in circulation by Cardano users, or is set aside for future block rewards. ADA that is already in is widely distributed and it is estimated that there are over [85 million ADA holders](https://cexplorer.io/article/how-many-ada-holders-are-there-in-the-world). This provides a diverse and active base of users. [Read more about the initial distribution here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano/tokenomics).

### Identity-Focused
Identity refers to the ability of a user to build a financial reputation from their activity on the blockchain. This is important because around 3 billion people are undocumented (meaning they don't have an official ID) and/or unbanked (meaning they are excluded from accessing financial services). Cardano's identity solutions provide an alternative way for these users to build a provable track record and gain access to wealth-building financial instruments like loans, investments, real estate, job opportunities, and more. 

Cardano's identity solutions also give individuals greater ownership of their personal data than in the current system. As things stand, we give out important information to many companies and trust them to keep it safe even though they often sell it, use it in bad ways, or lose it in data breaches. Identity solutions provide a new model in which you are the owner of your identity information and can share selectively only what is required and nothing more. 

See [Atala Prism](https://atalaprism.io/) and the [Identity Wallet](https://identity.cardanofoundation.org) for an intro to Cardano identify solutions. 

### Superior Staking
Cardano's Proof-of-Stake design is one of the best in crypto. The concept of staking is that you point your ADA to a block producing "stake pool" that you trust. The amount of stake delegated to a given stake pool is how the Cardano network chooses who should add the next block to the blockchain, and receive a monetary reward for doing so. This provides security to the Cardano system because it makes it more difficult and expensive for dishonest nodes to overcome honest stake pools and attack the Cardano system. In return for your assistance you earn ADA rewards every 5 days. 

You can stake with as little as 2 ADA. Staked ADA never leaves your wallet and can be spent freely anytime. [Over 60% of ADA currently in circulation is staked](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/k5r9B?s=huXqeQmi9qA). This broad participation contributes to the healthy security and decentralization of the network. Furthermore, the ongoing rewards from staking make ADA an attractive long-term asset to hold.   

[Learn more about staking here](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation/) and [see how much ADA you could earn from staking](https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator).


### Well-Established
Cardano was launched in 2017, making it one of the older crypto networks at this point. Since launching, Cardano has been in the top 10 by market cap and has developed a global user base in the millions. It is one of the most widely held and traded crypto assets and has [thousands of projects building on it](https://www.essentialcardano.io/development-update). It even ranked higher than Bitcoin for [brand intimacy](https://finbold.com/cardano-is-highest-ranking-crypto-brand-in-the-latest-top-brand-intimacy-2022-report/).

This wide availability and recognition gives Cardano and diverse base of users. These users contribute to its vibrant ecosystem and active governance. 

### Highly Reliable 
Cardano has had over 2000 days of 100% uptime since it launch in 2017. This is better than well-known companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. It is also better than many competing blockchains. Cardano has never had a restart, rollback, or fork. 

This resilience is a result of the thoughtful design and decentralization of Cardano. This strong foundation makes it well-suited for its role as a global financial platform, and a great place to build applications that require high availability. 

### Open-Source
The code behind Cardano is [open source](https://github.com/IntersectMBO). This builds trust because anyone can see exactly how the platform is built. It also allows any potential issues to be found and resolved quickly. 

The custodian of the source code is [Intersect](https://www.intersectmbo.org/), which is an organization that brings together community members to maintain Cardano's core technology and develop a roadmap for the future. Intersect serves as a central hub for community discussion, governance, and development within the Cardano community. 

### Great Place to Build 
Much like the internet, blockchains are open system that anyone can build projects on without permission. This allows for organic innovation as people create novel solutions to a variety of the world's problems. 

Cardano has a rapidly growing ecosystem of Dapps (decentralized applications). Dapp builders benefit from building on a robust platform with predictable transaction fees and an engaged community to match. Hundreds of projects have already launched and 1300+ more are in development. [Explore available Dapps here](https://www.cardanocube.com/cardano-ecosystem-interactive-map).

### Programmable Smart Contracts
The biggest factor to Cardano's versatility and flourishing ecosystem are smart contracts. Smart contracts are digital agreements that execute automatically once the conditions within them them are met. 

Smart contracts are a great way to re-create certain existing contracts to be executed by the blockchain. Beyond that, they provide a powerful building block to create complex applications on Cardano. These applications have the benefit that they treat all users equally because the interactions are automated by code. They can be trusted to always execute as written. 

Here are a few examples of what you can create with smart contracts: 

- **Contracts in Code** — You can create agreements between parties that are transparent and don't require intermediaries such as banks or lawyers. Agreements are executed exactly as specified by the code. 
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** — You can create new financial products that are automated based on the rules in their smart contracts. 
- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)** —You can create marketplaces where anyone can exchange digital assets.
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)** — You can create new ways to cooperate, vote, manage a shared treasury, and take collective action to achieve some shared purpose. 
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)** — You can create identity solutions where users control their own data and can build reputation
- **Supply Chain Systems** — You can create supply chain systems that allow businesses and consumers to see exactly where their goods come from.

Smart contracts are a versatile tool. There are many more uses than the ones highlighed above, including ones that haven't yet been invented. 

### Diverse Ecosystem
Over the last few years Cardano has seen the launch of a diverse explosion of projects, including DeFi, identity, NFTs, social media, telecom, AI, gaming, computing and much more. This variety is the basis for a healthy and sustainable economy, where users can find everything they need in one place. 

Some of the most promising Cardano projects are solving problems within their own domains, and using the Cardano platform to revolutionize existing industries. For example [World Mobile](https://worldmobile.io/) is rethinking telecom, [Book.io](https://book.io/) is disrupting publishing, [Axo Finance](https://www.axo.trade/) is building better trading platforms. 

### Engaged and Supportive Community 
Cardano has a committed and highly active community. Some of the main hubs of activity are [X](), [Twitter](), [Youtube](). There are also many [forums and discord channels]() you can check out to engage with the latest things happening on Cardano. 

### Ambitious and Well-Defined Roadmap
Cardano has a well-defined roadmap with 5 major stages. The stages can be simplified as: 
1. [Cardano Launch](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/byron/)
2. [Improve Decentralization](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/shelley/)
3. [Introduce Smart Contracts](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/)
4. [Scale the Blockchain](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/basho/) 
5. [Enable Governance](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/)

Stages 1 through 3 are mostly complete, though improvements continue. Now the focus is on stage 4 and 5. Stage 4, known as Basho, aims to improve scalability so the Cardano blockchain can handle more transactions and serve more users. Stage 5, known as Voltaire, is about enabling democratic governance so that users can vote to help decide Cardano's future. Read the [full roadmap here](https://roadmap.cardano.org/).

### Environmentally-Friendly 
There are multiple ways that blockchains come to agreement about what is the correct state of the blockchain. These are known as consensus mechanisms. Cardano operates using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. This is a good choice for energy efficiency because this uses a tiny fraction of the energy of Bitcoin's proof-of-work while still enjoying the same security guarantees. 

Cardano is over 200,000x more energy-efficient than Bitcoin. Check out the [latest statistics](https://cexplorer.io/energy) on Cardano's energy use. 

### Quickly Improving Developer Environment
There is an increasing number of languages that can create smart contracts. They can now be written in [Haskell](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus), [Python](https://opshin.dev/), [TypeScript](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plu-ts), [Go](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/plutigo), as well as dedicated Cardano languages like [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/). Smart contracts can even be created in a visual drag-and-drop way using [Marlowe](https://marlowe-finance.io/). This diversity of options make Cardano more accessible for developers from all backgrounds. 

Furthermore, additional development improvements are ongoing. Coding environments like [Demeter Run](https://demeter.run/), [Kuber IDE](https://kuberide.com/), and [Jambhala Dev Suite](https://github.com/iburzynski/jambhala) make it easy to get set up and start coding. Projects like [Lucid](https://lucid.spacebudz.io/) and [Mesh](https://meshjs.dev/) offer powerful building blocks for building  Dapps. [Plutus](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus), the original smart contract language, is undergoing continuous advancement and is adding new smart contract features. Design patterns and best practices on Cardano are being refined and standardized. 


### Third-Generation 
Bitcoin represents the first-generation of blockchain, which introduced secure and decentralized cryptocurrency networks to the world.

Ethereum is the original second-generation blockchain, which added programmability and smart contract capabilities, allowing users to interact with custom applications on the blockchain. 

Cardano is the third generation, which combines the best elements of Bitcoin (secure and decentralized sound money) and Ethereum (programmable smart contracts) while learning from the missteps of both. 

Cardano's founder Charles Hoskinson designed Cardano to specifically target the areas of interoperability, scalability, and sustainability for improvement. Read a summary of each one below, or read about these concepts in Cardano's documentation [here](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/why-use-cardano/).

#### Interoperable 
Interoperability is the property of being able to transfer value across blockchains and not just within the Cardano ecosystem. It also relates to the ability to interface with the traditional financial system. This is important because it facilitates the flow of money between platforms and improves the blockchain experience for users. 

There are a few ways this is being approached. One major approcah is the "side chain" or "partner chain" framework that being added to Cardano. This framework allows other custom blockchains to be created that can interact seamlessly with Cardano. [Midnight](https://midnight.network/), as an example, is a Cardano partner chain that is built to protect sensitive data. Partner chains can have custom features that make them especially suitable for a certain purpose, but they still benefit from the security and interoperability of the Cardano blockchain. 


#### Scalable 
Scalability refers to increasing the amount of activity that is possible on the network. The Cardano network has been designed from the start with scalability in mind. 

The Cardano network can handle many transactions while preserving decentralization. While this is sufficient for now, there are some initiatives that will further the Cardano network's ability to handle additional transactions. These include [Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/), [input endorsers](https://cexplorer.io/article/understanding-input-endorsers), network parameter increases, side chains, and layer 2s. Cardano is working to improve scaling with multiple different strategies as it continues to gain adoption. 

#### Sustainable
Sustainability in this context means the ability of the network to remain competitive in the long-term. Cardano has two main mechanisms to remain sustainable and self-sufficient:

The first element of long-term sustainability is governance, which puts the control of the Cardano network in the hands of users. This improves Cardano's long-term trajectory because it means the Cardano network can continuously adapt to the needs and desires of users through technological advances and parameter changes. Governance empowers the community to be very engaged, allowing users to have a real stake in decision making process. 

The second element of sustainability is the Cardano treasury. This is a substantial fund of ADA that is set aside for the growth of Cardano and its ecosystem. Once governance is implemented it will be managed by the Cardano community who can vote on how to best deploy treasury funds. The treasury is self-sustaining because it receives a small percentage of ADA from transaction fees and block rewards. As the Cardano grows it continues to grow as well. See the [current state of the treasury here](https://cexplorer.io/pot). 

### Forward-looking 
Cardano's development continues on many fronts. There are parallel efforts to improve Cardano's speed, resilience, privacy, governance, developer experience, and much more. The future of Cardano is looking bright and the community is welcoming. Feel free to get involved!
