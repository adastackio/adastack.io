# Getting Started On-Chain

Getting started on Cardano is easy. Here are the steps: 

<Steps>
### Set up a Wallet
A wallet allows you to interact with the Cardano blockchain. It can store digital assets, make and receive transactions, and interact with applications on Cardano (known as Dapps). 

#### Choose a Wallet 
These resources give some useful advice for choosing a wallet. If you just want to get started quickly, some great options are [Lace wallet](https://www.lace.io/) for browser and [Vespr wallet](https://vespr.xyz/) for mobile. For greater security you can start off with a [hardware wallet](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/hardware-wallet), but this requires ordering a device. Don't worry too much about which wallet you choose because you can always switch to a different wallet later.

#### Important Things to Know 
- When creating a wallet you receive a list of words known as a seed phrase. This is the master key to your funds. Write it down, keep it safe, don't share it, and don't store it online. Here are more [seed phrase tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/wiki/wallets/seedphrase/).
- Make sure you are downloading the wallet from the official website because scammers sometimes make fake websites to trick users. You can double-check the URL on [CardanoCube](https://www.cardanocube.io/collections/wallets) and [BuiltOnCardano](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/wallets).  
- If you want maximum security then it is recommended to get a hardware wallet. These devices store your crypto offline. They require you to enter a code into the device anytime you are sending funds or using an application. Because of these precautions they are one of the safest ways to hold cryptocurrency. [See Cardano hardware wallet options here](https://builtoncardano.com/ecosystem/hardware-wallet).  

### Buy ADA
ADA is available to buy on many Centralized Exchanges (CEXs). You can choose one that is available in your country and make an account. 

#### Choose an Exchange

[Cardano on Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/how-to-buy/cardano)  
[Cardano on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/how-to-buy/cardano)  

It is recommended to use a strong password and 2FA for your exchange account for security. 

#### Fund the Exchange using your Bank
To fund your exchange account you'll link it to your bank account. Follow the instructions on your exchange to do this. Once it is linked linked you can fund your exchange account.  

#### Make an Order
You can buy at the current price by using a "market order" or set a lower price you'd want to buy at using a "limit order". There are some other order types too for trading. You can [read more](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/crypto-order-types-101-from-market-to-limit/) about order types.

#### Send the ADA to your Wallet
Once you have purchased your ADA on an exchange you can send it to your wallet. [This guide explains](https://help.sundaeswap.finance/en/articles/5852067-how-to-transfer-your-ada-to-a-non-custodial-wallet) how to send ADA from an exchange to a wallet. 

### Use the Cardano Network
Once you have a wallet with some ADA in it there are many options available to you:  
- Send and receive assets
- Stake your ADA  
- Trade for other tokens on a decentralized exchange (DEX)  
- Use decentralized application (Dapp)  
- Buy an NFT on an NFT marketplace
