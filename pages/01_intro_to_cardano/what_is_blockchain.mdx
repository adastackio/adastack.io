# What is Blockchain?
Blockchain can be thought of as a digital list of transactions that exists on thousands of computers worldwide. These computers, known as nodes, communicate with each other to keep this list updated and verify that the blockchain's rules are being followed.

Users can own, send, and receive digital assets on the blockchain. When one user sends assets to another the transaction is stored in a block. Blocks are like the heartbeat of the blockchain, they are added to the blockchain at regular intervals. When a block is added to a blockchain it is cryptographically tied to all the previous blocks. This seals the contents so they cannot be edited, falsified, or destroyed. Blockchains are ideal for recording information where you want to ensure its permanence, such as balances of user's digital assets or timestamped records of important events. 

The security and continuity of blockchains networks is enhanced by their decentralization. Blockchains are made up of thousands of individual nodes communicating together. Anyone can run a node and independently verify that everything is working according to the rules of the blockchain. The global distribution of nodes ensure that the blockchain will remain available in the case of an unexpected disruption. If some nodes go offline for any reason then other nodes are able to maintain the continued operation of the network. 

## What can you do with Blockchain? 
Blockchain networks provide an open, reliable, global, always-on network in which the rules are clearly defined and equally enforced. Unlike the traditional financial system, where billions don't have access, blockchain networks provide an inclusive platform that is available to anyone with an internet connection. 

This provides the foundation upon which vibrant parallel economies are being built. Users can own digital assets, make transactions, set up digital contracts, build applications, create businesses, and cooperate in novel ways toward shared goals. Blockchains are new economic systems that give agency to common people. 

## Properties of Blockchain
Blockchains are likely to be useful anytime there is a need for transparency, security, and trust. Here are some of their main properties:

**Inclusive**: Anyone can use an open blockchain systes like Bitcoin or Cardano without needing permission. Blockchain allows all users a level playing field on which they can exercise economic agency. 

**Always-on**: Blockchains are built to operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Transactions settle in minutes. 

**Peer-to-peer**: Transactions happen directly peer-to-peer. This reduces fees, cuts out middlemen, reduces dependence on third-parties, and increases overall efficiency. 

**Transparent**: In general, everything happens on a blockchain is transparent and openly viewable. This promotes trust and accountability because you can verify the actions of public parties, as well as the proper functioning of the blockchain itself. There is still the ability to be anonymous however, because it is a user's choice if they want to publicly say which addresses belong to them. 

**Decentralized**: Blockchains are made of nodes that are distributed globally. This wide geographic distribution ensures redundancy of the ledger and allows the network to operate regardless of political status in any particular country, internet outages, or other possible disruptions. 

**Highly resilient**: Blockchains are built to be resilient because they are extremely expensive and difficult to attack. For example, the latest [study from CoinMetrics](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=426022009020028078025124126082084023037021070063025049029099080109000094068091012099009033049061045022049089119115099126118067042034044050085100117070118127080127108039042048113090065098031123123124000114114126114096105088007114113127121101120088124127&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUEa) demonstrates that it would cost at least $5.5 billon in equipment, and $1.5 million per hour of electricity, to just temporarily disrupt Bitcoin.

**Censorship resistant**: Due to their decentralized architecture, there is no central authority that can control, alter, or censor transactions or data stored on the blockchain. This is useful because they can be trusted to remain neutral, open, and secure locations to hold data and assets. They can also be used to ensure freedom of expression if needed. 

**Immutable**: Data stored on a blockchain is tamper-proof and unchangeable once it has been added to the blockchain. That is because, once a block has been validated and added to the blockchain, it becomes part of a chain of blocks that are cryptographically linked together. This makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to alter the data in that block without consensus from the majority of the network.
