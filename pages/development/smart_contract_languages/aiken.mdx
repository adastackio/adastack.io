# Aiken

Aiken is a specialized programming language for building smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. It simplifies dApp creation with clean, Rust-inspired syntax. Aiken emphasizes clear documentation, readable error messages, and efficient smart contracts.

Aiken also provides a toolkit of developer utilities including integrated testing tools, performance analysis, and cost execution information. Because it is a popular choice for smart contract programming, there are many supplemental libraries and resources to learn.
