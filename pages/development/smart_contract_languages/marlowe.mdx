# Marlowe

Marlowe is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to create financial smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. It provides a visual interface, allowing non-programmers to create and execute smart contracts using interconnecting blocks.

It provides a simplified approach to smart contract development, making it an ideal solution for organizations looking to automate financial operations on the blockchain. It also provides built-in safety guardrails, to ensure contracts execute safely and as expected.
