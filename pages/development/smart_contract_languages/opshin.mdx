# OpShin

OpShin is a Python-based programming language for developing secure smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. It is 100% valid Python, meaning you can leverage the existing tool stack for Python, including syntax highlighting, linting, debugging, unit-testing, property-based testing, and verification. Because it is Python, writing OpShin contracts is intuitive and reduces the barrier of entry to create custom validators in Cardano.
