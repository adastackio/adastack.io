# Helios

Helios offers web developers a simpler, JavaScript/TypeScript-based alternative to Cardano's native Plutus smart contract language. It streamlines dApp creation by combining on-chain and off-chain code capabilities into a single toolkit, eliminating the need to switch languages during development.
