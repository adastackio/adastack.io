# Intro to Cardano Development

Cardano development is the process of writing code that interacts with the Cardano blockchain. Cardano supports development in multiple programming languages like Haskell, Plutus, Aiken and JavaScript/TypeScript, enabling creation of smart contracts, decentralized applications, infrastructure tools and more to advance the Cardano blockchain.

### Areas of Focus in Cardano Development

- **Smart Contract Development**: Using languages like Plutus and Marlowe, developers can create smart contracts for decentralized applications (DApps) and automate transactions and agreements on the Cardano blockchain.

- **DApp Development**: Building decentralized applications on Cardano allows developers to create a wide range of applications spanning industries such as finance, supply chain management, gaming, voting systems, and more.

- **Wallet Development**: Developers can build wallets that allow users to securely store, send, and receive ADA and interact with decentralized applications and smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.

- **Infrastructure and Tools Development**: Creating infrastructure and tools such as blockchain explorers, metrics dashboards, ecosystem explorers, and developer tools that facilitate interaction with the Cardano blockchain.

- **Protocol Development**: Cardano is an open-source project, and developers can contribute to its core protocol by proposing and implementing improvements, new features, and enhancements.
