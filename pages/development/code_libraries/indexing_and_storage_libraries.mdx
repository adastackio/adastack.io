# Indexing and Storage Libraries

Tools and services that index and organize Cardano blockchain data, making it easier to store, query, and analyze blockchain information efficiently.

Indexing libraries help to process the blockchain into a form where it the data can be easily queried. They can filter for specific addresses, assets, or transactions. They enable developers to access blockchain data in a way they can use.

#### Cardano-DB-Sync

Cardano-DB-Sync is a tool that continuously syncs the Cardano blockchain with a PostgreSQL database. It allows users to efficiently query and analyze blockchain data in real-time.

#### Kupo

Kupo is a lightweight chain-indexing tool for the Cardano blockchain. It quickly syncs data by matching addresses in transaction outputs and creates a lookup table for easy access to output references, values, and scripts.

#### Carp

Carp is an indexer, built in Rust, that syncs blockchain data into a PostgreSQL database. Itâ€™s designed for speed and flexibility, making it ideal for production applications like wallets. It has an indexer for storing data and a web server with a REST API for database queries.

#### Scrolls

Scrolls is a Rust-based library designed for building and managing read-optimized collections of Cardano blockchain data. It efficiently crawls the blockchain, aggregates data, and keeps data updated by monitoring the chain tip.

#### LedgerSync

LedgerSync is a Java application for indexing Cardano blockchain data. It reads from the Cardano blockchain and writes it to a PostgreSQL database. There is also a streaming app that publishes events to messaging middleware like Kafka or RabbitMQ.

#### Yaci-store

Yaci Store is a modular indexer library written in Java for the Cardano blockchain. It helps developers write their own scoped indexers in Java, Kotlin, or any other JVM language. It also provides a few out-of-the-box indexers, such as yaci-store-all, which indexes all on-chain data into databases like H2, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.
