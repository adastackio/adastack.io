# Node Libraries

Libraries for running and interfacing with Cardano nodes.

## Node Implementations

A collection of implementations of the Cardano node, providing different approaches to running and interacting with the Cardano network.

#### Cardano Node

The Cardano node is the core component to participate in the Cardano blockchain. It serves as the means for stake pool operators to produce blocks, and for all network participants to interact with the Cardano network.

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Haskell"
  repoURL="https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node"
/>

#### Dolos

Dolos is a lightweight Cardano data node that maintains a current ledger copy and handles queries from trusted clients. Its serves as an efficient backend for dApps and indexers.

    {
      discordChannelName: "TxPipe #Dolos",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/ZTHcHUy5HY",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Amaru

Amaru is a Cardano node client written in Rust. It aims to bring more node diversity to Cardano. It is currently in development.

      discordChannelName: "Harmonic Labs",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/CGKNcG7ade",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Dingo

Dingo is a lightweight Cardano data node written in Go that connects to the Cardano network using the Ouroboros protocol. It functions as a data service layer, reading blockchain data and serving it to dApps, data services, and analytics platforms.

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Go"
  repoURL="https://github.com/blinklabs-io/dingo"

    {
      discordChannelName: "Blink Labs",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/5fPRZnX4qW",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Node Tools

Libraries that facilitate direct interaction with Cardano nodes and offer various interfaces for node communication and management.

#### Ogmios

A lightweight bridge between the Cardano node and client applications, enabling efficient communication. It allows developers to use JSON and RPC for operations like querying ledger state, submitting transactions, and monitoring the mempool.

- [Ogmios Documentation](https://ogmios.dev/)

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Haskell"
  repoURL="https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios"
  discord={[
    {
      discordChannelName: "IOG Technical Community",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/inputoutput",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Oura

Oura is tool that monitors a Cardano node in real-time. It allows filtering, saving, and reacting to on-chain events. Oura does not provide chain-indexing directly, but it supports sinks where filtered data can be stored (e.g. Elastic Search or Kafka).

- [Oura Documentation](https://txpipe.github.io/oura/)

      discordChannelName: "TxPipe #Oura",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/ZTHcHUy5HY",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Pallas

Pallas re-implements common Ouroboros and Cardano logic in native Rust. It can be useful for building wallets, explorers, or custom node implementations. It is a collection of modules, so developers can use only what they need.

    {
      discordChannelName: "TxPipe #Pallas",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/ZTHcHUy5HY",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### gOuroboros

gOuroboros is a Go implementation of the Cardano Ouroboros family of protocols, allowing developers to write Go apps that communicate with Cardano nodes or manage blocks/transactions.

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Go"
  repoURL="https://github.com/blinklabs-io/gouroboros"
  discord={[
    {
      discordChannelName: "Blink Labs",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/5fPRZnX4qW",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Adder

Adder is a tool that monitors the Cardano blockchain and emits events as blocks and transactions occur. It provides developers with the ability to create custom indexers, allowing them to filter and track specific blockchain data efficiently.

- [Adder Starter Kit](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/adder-library-starter-kit)

      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/5fPRZnX4qW",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Yaci

Yaci allows connection and interaction with Cardano nodes directly. The library provides capabilities to listen to incoming blocks in real-time, fetch previous blocks, and monitor the local mempool.

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Java"
  repoURL="https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci"
  discord={[
    {
      discordChannelName: "Roasted Bean Alliance",

    },
  ]}
/>

#### Kogmios

Kogmios is a Kotlin client library for Cardano's Ogmios interface, designed to simplify interaction with Cardano nodes by abstracting away the complexities of WebSocket and JSON-WSP message handling.

    },
  ]}
/>

#### OgmiosDotnet

OgmiosDotnetClient is a .NET client library designed to facilitate communication with a Cardano Node via the Ogmios WebSocket interface. It enables developers to synchronize blockchain data from a specific point, retrieve block information, and handle real-time blockchain events.
