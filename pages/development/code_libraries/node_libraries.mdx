# Node Libraries

Libraries for running and interfacing with Cardano nodes.

## Node Implementations

A collection of implementations of the Cardano node, providing different approaches to running and interacting with the Cardano network.

#### Cardano Node

The Cardano node is the core component to participate in the Cardano blockchain. It serves as the means for stake pool operators to produce blocks, and for all network participants to interact with the Cardano network.

<LibraryInfo
  language="Haskell"
  repoURL="https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node"
  docsURL="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/wiki"
/>

#### Dolos

Dolos is a lightweight Cardano data node that maintains a current ledger copy and handles queries from trusted clients. Its serves as an efficient backend for dApps and indexers.

    },
  ]}
/>

## Node Tools

Libraries that facilitate direct interaction with Cardano nodes and offer various interfaces for node communication and management.

#### Ogmios

A lightweight bridge between the Cardano node and client applications, enabling efficient communication. It allows developers to use JSON and RPC for operations like querying ledger state, submitting transactions, and monitoring the mempool.

<LibraryInfo
  language="Haskell"
  repoURL="https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios"
  docsURL="https://ogmios.dev/"
  discord={[
    {
      DiscordServerName: "IOG Technical Community",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/inputoutput",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Oura

Oura is tool that monitors a Cardano node in real-time. It allows filtering, saving, and reacting to on-chain events. Oura does not provide chain-indexing directly, but it supports sinks where filtered data can be stored (e.g. Elastic Search or Kafka).

<LibraryInfo
  language="Rust"
  repoURL="https://github.com/txpipe/oura/"
  docsURL="https://txpipe.github.io/oura/"
  discord={[
    {
      DiscordServerName: "TxPipe #Oura",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/ZTHcHUy5HY",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Pallas

Pallas re-implements common Ouroboros and Cardano logic in native Rust. It can be useful for building wallets, explorers, or custom node implementations. It is a collection of modules, so developers can use only what they need.

<LibraryInfo
  language="Rust"
  repoURL="https://github.com/txpipe/pallas"
  docsURL="https://github.com/txpipe/pallas"
  discord={[
    {
      DiscordServerName: "TxPipe #Pallas",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/ZTHcHUy5HY",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### gOuroboros

gOuroboros is a Go implementation of the Cardano Ouroboros family of protocols, allowing developers to write Go apps that communicate with Cardano nodes or manage blocks/transactions.

    },
  ]}
/>

#### Kogmios

Kogmios is a Kotlin client library for Cardano's Ogmios interface, designed to simplify interaction with Cardano nodes by abstracting away the complexities of WebSocket and JSON-WSP message handling.
