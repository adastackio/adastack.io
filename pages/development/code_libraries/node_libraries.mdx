# Node Libraries

Libraries for running and interfacing with Cardano nodes.

## Node Implementations

A collection of implementations of the Cardano node, providing different approaches to running and interacting with the Cardano network.

#### Cardano Node

The Cardano node is the core component to participate in the Cardano blockchain. It serves as the means for stake pool operators to produce blocks, and for all network participants to interact with the Cardano network.

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Haskell"
  repoURL="https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node"
/>

#### Dolos

Dolos is a specialized Cardano data node, designed to maintain an up-to-date copy of the ledger and respond to queries from trusted clients (but does not produce blocks or handle relays). Since it is optimized for providing data, It is smaller than the Cardano node. Dolos can be an efficient backend for dApps and a useful data source for indexers.

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Rust"
  repoURL="https://github.com/txpipe/dolos"
  discord={[
    {
      discordChannelName: "TxPipe #Dolos",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/ZTHcHUy5HY",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Amaru

Amaru is a Cardano node client written in Rust. It aims to bring more node diversity to Cardano. It is currently in development.

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Rust"
  repoURL="https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru"
  discord={[
    {
      discordChannelName: "Pragma #Amaru",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.gg/M65GBpkGjK",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Node Tools

Libraries that facilitate direct interaction with Cardano nodes, offering various interfaces for node communication and management.

#### Ogmios

A lightweight bridge between the Cardano node and client applications, enabling efficient communication. It allows developers to use JSON and RPC for operations like querying ledger state, submitting transactions, and monitoring the mempool.

- [Ogmios Documentation](https://ogmios.dev/)

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Haskell"
  repoURL="https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios"
  discord={[
    {
      discordChannelName: "IOG Technical Community",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/inputoutput",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Oura

Oura is tool that monitors a Cardano node in real-time. It allows filtering, saving, and reacting to on-chain events. Oura does not provide chain-indexing directly, but it supports sinks where filtered data can be stored (e.g. Elastic Search or Kafka).

- [Oura Documentation](https://txpipe.github.io/oura/)

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Rust"
  repoURL="https://github.com/txpipe/oura/"
  discord={[
    {
      discordChannelName: "TxPipe #Oura",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/ZTHcHUy5HY",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Pallas

Pallas re-implements common Ouroboros and Cardano logic in native Rust. It can be useful for building wallets, explorers, or custom node implementations. It is a collection of modules, so developers can use only what they need.

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Rust"
  repoURL="https://github.com/txpipe/pallas"
  discord={[
    {
      discordChannelName: "TxPipe #Pallas",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/ZTHcHUy5HY",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Cardano Node Tests

Cardano Node Tests is a library provides system and end-to-end (E2E) tests for cardano-node, allowing developers to run comprehensive tests on node implementations.

- [Cardano-node-tests Documentation](https://tests.cardano.intersectmbo.org/)

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Python"

#### Adder

Adder is a tool that monitors the Cardano blockchain and emits events as blocks and transactions occur. It provides developers with the ability to create custom indexers, allowing them to filter and track specific blockchain data efficiently.

- [Adder Starter Kit](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/adder-library-starter-kit)

      discordChannelName: "Blink Labs",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/5fPRZnX4qW",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Yaci

Yaci allows connection and interaction with Cardano nodes directly. The library provides capabilities to listen to incoming blocks in real-time, fetch previous blocks, and monitor the local mempool.
