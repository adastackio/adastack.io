# Registries

Curated directories that maintain verified information about the Cardano ecosystem, such as collections of smart contracts, verified tokens, and security information.

#### Cardano Token Registry

The Cardano token registry is where token creators submit verified information about their tokens, including names, descriptions, and logos.

#### Metadata Registry Testnet

Metadata Registry Testnet provides a way to register off-chain token metadata that can map to on-chain identifiers (typically hashes representing asset IDs, output locking scripts, or token forging policies). It is intended for use with testnets, use the Cardano Token Registry instead for mainnet.
