# Serialization Libraries

Libraries and tools focused on data serialization and deserialization for Cardano blockchain data structures, ensuring consistent data handling across different platforms.

Serialization means converting data between formats so they can be easily transmitted and stored. Serialization and deserialization of CBOR is required when reading from or writing data to the Cardano blockchain.

#### Cardano Serialization Library (CSL)

Cardano Serialization Library, written in Rust, serializes and deserializes data structures using Cardano's official specifications. It supports multiple programming languages, including Node.js, JavaScript, WebAssembly, and Rust.
