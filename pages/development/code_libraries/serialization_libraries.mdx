# Serialization Libraries

Libraries and tools for converting data structures between formats, ensuring efficient and consistent data handling across the Cardano blockchain.

#### Cardano Serialization Library (CSL)

Cardano Serialization Library, written in Rust, serializes and deserializes data structures using Cardano's official specifications. It supports multiple programming languages, including Node.js, JavaScript, WebAssembly, and Rust.
