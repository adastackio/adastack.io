# Testing Libraries

Tools designed to test Cardano smart contracts, transactions, and blockchain interactions. Test smart contracts and dApps to ensure quality and security.

#### Naumanchia

Naumachia is a framework for creating and testing smart contracts that offers a set of tools and abstractions.

    {
      discordChannelName: "TxPipe #Naumanchia",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/ZTHcHUy5HY",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Yaci DevKit

Yaci DevKit is a development toolkit for Cardano that allows developers to create custom devnets in seconds, enabling rapid iteration and experimentation. It includes tools like the Yaci CLI, Yaci Store (a lightweight chain indexer), and Yaci Viewer (a browser-based blockchain data viewer).

      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/JtQ54MSw6p",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Quickcheck Dynamic

QuickCheck-dynamic is a Haskell library designed for testing stateful systems, including smart contracts, using property-based testing techniques. It allows a developer to define a model of their system's behavior, generate test cases, and verify that the implementation meets the specified properties.

    {
      discordChannelName: "IOG Technical Community",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/inputoutput",
    },
  ]}

#### Plutus Bench

Test and benchmark Plutus Smart Contracts.

<LibraryInfoBar
  language="Python"
  repoURL="https://github.com/OpShin/plutus-bench"
  discord={[
    {
      discordChannelName: "OpShin",
      discordInviteURL: "https://discord.com/invite/umR3A2g4uw",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Vodka

Vodka is a Cardano development toolkit designed to use with Aiken. It includes unit test utilities to build transactions for testing purposes.
