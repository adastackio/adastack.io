# Cardano Stake Pool Explorers

Stake Pool Explorers are tools for searching or browsing stake pools. 

- [AdaPools](https://adapools.org/)
- [PoolTool.io](https://pooltool.io/)
- [Adafolio.com](https://adafolio.com/) shows community-created portfolios of stake pools. Their portfolios have useful categories like "Charity Pools" or "Community Developers". These portfolios will be especially interesting once multi-delegation staking is released. [Support](https://adafolio.com/support) by staking to [VIPER pool](https://viperstaking.com/).
