# What are Partner Chains?
Partner chains, also known as interconnected blockchains, revolutionize collaboration beyond standalone blockchain structures. They aim to establish a collaborative network where each blockchain's strengths are utilized to enhance others. By connecting diverse blockchains, partner chains leverage unique attributes like security, liquidity, reliability, scalability, and interoperability, paving the way for innovative solutions that surpass individual blockchain limitations.
