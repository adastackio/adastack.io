# What are Partner Chains?
Partner chains, also known as sidechains, are interconnected blockchains that can interact with the main Cardano network. The aim is to establish a constellation of blockchains where each blockchain's strengths compliments the others. By connecting diverse blockchains, partner chains leverage unique attributes like security, liquidity, reliability, scalability, and interoperability, paving the way for innovative solutions going beyond individual blockchains.

### Features and Capabilities of Cardano's Partner Chains
Cardano's partner chains offer many features and capabilities designed to empower developers and users alike. These partner chains can seamlessly access Cardano's native token, ADA, and leverage its robust smart contract capabilities. Moreover, they have the flexibility to customize their consensus protocols, governance models, and token economics, all while leveraging Cardano's security and compatibility.

### Benefits of Partner Chains
Partner chains represent a paradigm shift in the blockchain industry, offering a myriad of benefits. By overcoming the limitations and trade-offs of individual blockchains, partner chains foster a more diverse and inclusive ecosystem. Additionally, they accelerate the adoption and innovation of blockchain technology by providing greater value and choice to users.
