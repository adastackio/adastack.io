# What are Partner Chains?

Sidechains are separate blockchains that connect with Cardano. They enable unique blockchains to connect together. Users can transfer digital assets securely between these linked networks.

### What are the Benefits of Sidechains?

1. Scalability: Side chains help process some transactions instead of the main Cardano chain. This helps ensure users can get transactions through quickly and cheaply.

2. Flexibility: Different sidechains offer different attributes, providing users more options. Some are optimized for fast transaction speed, low fees, privacy, and other specialized purposes.

3. Security: Sidechains can leverage the security and decentralization of existing Cardano nodes. This allows them to bootstrap their networks with a secure foundation. Over time they can transition to more independence.

4. Interoperability: Sidechains allow users to transfer their assets between blockchain networks. This means users can move to the ideal blockchain system for their needs. Asset movement is secured using a secure and carefully-designed 2-way peg mechanism.
